Hey everyone, this is Christina from
0:02
OpenAI. Welcome to Agent Builder 101.
0:05
Agent Builder is a new visual tool for
0:08
building AI workflows. You connect nodes
0:10
and create agents without writing any
0:12
code. So you can start from templates or
0:15
build your own from scratch. And it also
0:17
comes with built-in eval so you can test
0:19
and understand how your agents perform.
0:22
When you're ready, you can export the
0:23
workflow as code or drop it straight
0:26
into your product. Basically, it's your
0:28
all-in-one space to design, test, and
0:31
launch AI agents visually and fast. So,
0:35
today we're going to show you how to
0:36
build your first agentic workflow, a
0:38
helpful travel agent that will help you
0:40
either build an itinerary or look up
0:42
flight information. So, we're starting
0:44
here in the OpenAI platform.
0:47
Every workflow starts with a start node
0:49
where you can set input variables or
0:51
state variables. And today for the
0:53
travel agent, the defaults are great.
0:57
Next, I'll connect a classifier agent.
0:58
I'm going to be building a specialized
1:01
itinerary agent in addition to a
1:03
specialized flight agent. And so, I want
1:05
to first determine which agent I should
1:06
route to. So, I'll call this classifier.
1:10
So, you are a helpful travel assistant
1:13
for classifying whether a message is
1:17
about an itinerary or a flight.
1:23
And here I'll specify the output format
1:26
as JSON. And I'll add a property called
1:29
classification
1:31
which will have two options either
1:33
flight info or itinerary.
1:38
Great.
1:39
Next, I'll add in an if else node um to
1:42
branch based off of the classification.
1:45
So if
1:47
put pars.classification classification
1:52
is flight info then we want to branch to
1:55
the flight agent and otherwise we want
1:58
to branch into the um the itinerary
2:01
agent. So from the flight agent we'll
2:03
create a new node and we'll call this
2:07
flight agent.
2:09
You are a travel assistant.
2:12
always recommend a specific flight to go
2:17
to.
2:19
Use airport codes.
2:23
And here I'll also give it access to web
2:25
search so I can have the most up-to-date
2:27
information about flights.
2:32
Great. For the itinerary agent, I'll
2:36
build um an itinerary agent with a new
2:39
agent node.
2:42
You are a travel assistant.
2:45
So build a concise
2:49
itinerary.
2:51
Great. I think that's everything we need
2:52
to get started with our travel agent. So
2:55
here in run preview, I'll ask it what
2:57
should I do in a day in Tokyo.
3:01
And I can see the message going through
3:03
the workflow that we just created. going
3:04
through the classifier agent, deciding
3:06
which category it should go to, seeing
3:09
that I asked about an itinerary, and
3:11
then passing it on to the itinerary
3:13
agent, whereas come up with a concise
3:15
one-day itinerary for Tokyo. Looks like
3:17
a great day. Now, for the flight agent,
3:20
I actually want a richer experience for
3:22
showing flight information instead of
3:24
just plain text. And so, I can do that
3:26
by going and building a widget in our
3:27
widget studio. Here I've actually
3:29
already designed um a widget for showing
3:32
flight information to go from one
3:34
location to the next with um all the
3:36
details about the flight. So I can just
3:38
click download um to download this
3:40
entire template and then bring that
3:42
directly to the agent um that we just
3:45
created here. I'll add it in as the
3:48
widgets output format. I'll upload this
3:51
flight widget that we just pulled.
3:54
Preview it. Everything looks great. And
3:56
I actually want this to be a bit more
3:58
customized. Um, and so I will tell it to
4:02
choose a background color
4:06
creatively
4:07
based on the destination.
4:12
And I'll also ask it to include time
4:16
zones A.M. or PM.
4:21
Great. Let's test it out.
4:26
SFO to Tokyo on October 7th.
4:30
So here again, we see it moving through
4:31
the classifier agent um determining
4:34
whether I'm asking about um a flight or
4:37
an itinerary, deciding that I'm asking
4:39
about a flight agent um or deciding that
4:41
I'm asking about a flight, searching the
4:43
web, finding a flight for me, and then
4:45
showing it to me in this rich
4:46
interactive way. In this case, it's
4:49
decided that yellow is the color of
4:51
Tokyo. Um, and so showed that as the
4:53
background color.
4:56
Great. So I've now built an agent that
4:58
I'm happy with and I can publish it
5:00
directly. Let's call it travel agent
5:02
here.
5:03
And I now have a fully deployed agent
5:05
that is ready to go. Um, I can either
5:08
use the agents SDK. And here you can see
5:10
that this is quite a bit of code um for
5:12
me to manage myself
5:15
or I can simply take this workflow ID
5:17
and put it in my product directly using
5:19
jacket. So that's all. Hope that was
5:21
helpful and please leave any feedback in
5:23
the comments and don't forget to

5:27
product updates. Thank you.
