## Project Context

This artifact captures structured travel preferences extracted from a natural language travel request. It serves as the foundation for the travel planning pipeline, where it will be used by the destination-guide agent to conduct research and by the itinerary-designer agent to create a detailed day-by-day trip plan. The preferences ensure that all planning aligns with the user's stated requirements for destination, duration, interests, pace, and budget.

### Key Concepts

**Primary Interests**: The main types of activities and experiences the user wants to prioritize during their trip, such as food, culture, outdoor activities, or nightlife.

**Travel Style**: The overall approach to travel that reflects accommodation preferences, transportation choices, and activity selection, ranging from budget backpacker to luxury traveler.

**Trip Pace**: The preferred activity density and energy level, ranging from fast-paced with many daily activities to leisurely with ample downtime and rest periods.

**Budget Level**: The general spending category that guides cost-related recommendations for accommodations, dining, activities, and transportation.

**Geographic Scope**: The physical boundaries of the trip, specifying whether planning should focus on a single city, include surrounding regions, or allow day trips to nearby areas.


### Core Capabilities

- Extract structured travel requirements from natural language requests
- Capture destination, duration, and timing preferences
- Document activity interests and travel style preferences
- Record budget constraints and spending priorities
- Identify gaps in user requirements for operator clarification
- Provide validated preferences for downstream research and itinerary planning

### Key Principles

- Preserve user intent by capturing exact language and stated preferences without interpretation
- Prioritize explicitly stated preferences over inferred assumptions
- Maintain completeness by ensuring all required preference fields are populated
- Support single-destination trips to maintain planning simplicity
- Enable operator review by flagging ambiguous or missing requirements
