### Practical Travel Tips


- IC card (Suica or Pasmo) essential for convenient transit; purchase at any station, load with ¥2,000-5,000 initially, reload as needed at machines

- Cash remains king despite Tokyo's modernity; ATMs at 7-Eleven and Japan Post accept international cards; withdraw ¥20,000-30,000 for 1-day budget

- Download Google Maps and Tokyo Subway Navigation apps for offline maps and route planning; both work excellently in Tokyo

- Train station exits can be extremely confusing with 20+ exits; check exit number/name in advance to avoid surfacing far from destination

- Most restaurants display plastic food models in windows; point to order if language barrier exists; English menus increasingly common in tourist areas

- Convenience stores (7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawson) are everywhere and offer clean bathrooms, ATMs, and quality ready-to-eat food and drinks

- Free WiFi is limited; consider pocket WiFi rental or international phone plan for reliable connectivity throughout day

- Late October weather is comfortable (15-20°C/59-68°F) with low humidity; light jacket recommended for evenings; occasional rain possible

- Many restaurants have specific lunch hours (11:30 AM-2:00 PM) and dinner service starts around 5:30-6:00 PM; some close between services

- Train punctuality is extreme; if train scheduled for 10:23, it arrives at 10:23; rushing causes stress so allow buffer time

- Trash cans are rare on streets; carry plastic bag for trash until finding disposal location at convenience stores or stations

- Business hours vary; many shops open 10-11 AM and close 8-9 PM; restaurants may close early on weekdays; verify hours before visiting

- Japanese customer service is exceptional; staff are helpful but often speak limited English; patience and simple language appreciated

- Escalator etiquette: stand on left in Tokyo (opposite of Osaka), walk on right; follow local patterns to avoid blocking flow



### Local Customs & Cultural Notes

Japanese culture emphasizes respect, politeness, and consideration for others. Key customs include bowing as greeting (slight bow sufficient for tourists), removing shoes when entering homes, temples, and some restaurants (look for shoe racks or raised floors). When dining, say 'itadakimasu' before eating and 'gochisosama' after finishing. Avoid eating while walking on streets; instead, eat near the vendor or at designated areas. Speaking loudly on public transportation is considered rude; phone calls should be avoided or taken quietly. Tipping is not practiced and can cause confusion or offense; excellent service is standard expectation. When using chopsticks, never stick them vertically in rice (funeral custom) or pass food chopstick-to-chopstick. Cash remains important despite Tokyo's modernity; carry yen as many small shops and restaurants don't accept cards. Queuing is orderly and respected; wait in line patiently and board trains only after passengers exit. Tattoos may restrict access to some onsen (hot springs) and public baths. Smoking is prohibited on most streets but allowed in designated smoking areas; many restaurants have smoking sections.
