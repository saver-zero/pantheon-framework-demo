### Practical Travel Tips

- Bring layers as desert temperatures can swing dramatically between day and night, even in October

- Stay hydrated when participating in outdoor activities as the desert climate can be unexpectedly dehydrating

- Book fine dining reservations well in advance, especially for celebrity chef restaurants

- Consider renting a car for at least one day to access outdoor attractions like Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam

- Take advantage of happy hour specials at many upscale restaurants for more affordable fine dining experiences

- Use rideshare services or the monorail to avoid parking fees and driving stress on the Strip

- Carry small bills for tipping as some establishments may have difficulty making change for large bills

- Apply sunscreen even in October as desert sun can be intense, especially during outdoor activities

- Many outdoor attractions close earlier in the evening, so plan accordingly for daylight activities

- Check for combination tickets or packages that might offer savings on multiple attractions

### Local Customs & Cultural Notes

Las Vegas has a relatively relaxed atmosphere compared to other destinations. Tipping is customary (15-20% at restaurants, $1-2 per bag for bellhops, $2-5 per night for housekeeping). Many attractions are indoors due to the desert climate, so dress comfortably but be prepared for temperature differences between hot outdoors and air-conditioned venues. Gambling is legal but remember it's meant for entertainment, not as a way to make money.
