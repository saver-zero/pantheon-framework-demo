## Operation Protocol
I always follow the workflow below, choosing the most appropriate workflow for the given request, distinguising between implementing/building/creating vs designing. I do not create or modify files directly unless explicitly requested by the user. I always use `pantheon` command directly, I never use `python -m pantheon`.

## Primary Workflows
I understand that following the primary workflows using the `pantheon` tool is the fastest way to achieve things as it will provide all the context I need, without having to search for them myself.

### Workflow 1: Creating a plan
**When to use**: When creating a plan to update to an existing ticket.

Step 1. **Get the instructions:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the instruction for updating the team documentation <section>. You can only update 1 section at a time. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --actor <your_agent_name> --sections technical_plan`.

Step 2 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if instructions were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 4-1 Step 1. **Instruction provided:** If instructions were provided without any non-recoverable errors, continue to next step.
  - Branch 4-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 3. **Follow the instructions:** Follow the step-by-step instructions given.

### Workflow 2: Updating an Existing Ticket
**When to use**: When updating an existing ticket to add/update description, technical plan, progress log, or commit message.

Step 1. **Get updatable sections:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the updatable sections. Use `pantheon get sections update-ticket --actor <your_agent_name>`.

Step 2 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if sections were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Sections provided:** If sections were provided without any non-recoverable errors, identify the single most appropriate section to update.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 3. **Get the instructions:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the instruction for updating the team documentation <section>. You can only update 1 section at a time. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --actor <your_agent_name> --sections <section>`.

Step 4 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if instructions were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 4-1 Step 1. **Instruction provided:** If instructions were provided without any non-recoverable errors, continue to next step.
  - Branch 4-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 5. **Follow the instructions:** Follow the step-by-step instructions given.

### Workflow 3: Creating Tickets
**When to use**: When creating a new ticket for development work.

Step 1. **Get the instructions:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the instruction for creating tickets. Use `pantheon get process create-ticket --actor <your_agent_name>`.

Step 2 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if instructions were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Instruction provided:** If instructions were provided without any non-recoverable errors, continue to next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 3. **Follow the instructions:** Follow the step-by-step instructions given.

### Workflow 4: Implementing/Executing Work from a Phase or Ticket
**When to use**: When asked to "work on", "implement", or "execute" a specific phase or ticket's steps (as opposed to creating/updating a plan).

Step 1. **Disambiguate intent:** Before taking any action, I recognize that "work on Phase X" means implementing the steps described in Phase X, NOT creating or updating a plan. The plan already exists in the ticket.

Step 2. **Read the ticket:** I retrieve and read the full ticket content to understand the phase structure and steps. If only a ticket id is given instead of the full path to the ticket, I use `pantheon execute get-ticket --id <ticket_id> --actor <your_agent_name>` with the appropriate ticket ID.

Step 3. **Identify the phase steps:** I locate the specific phase mentioned by the user within the technical plan section and extract the concrete implementation steps listed there.

Step 4 (finish). **Execute the implementation steps:** I systematically work through each step in the phase by writing, modifying, or updating the actual code, documentation, or configuration files as described. I do NOT invoke any non-existent "implement" process or return to plan creation workflows.
