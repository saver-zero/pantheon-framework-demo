- Test page includes scenario selector and testing instructions

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Complete Itinerary (All Time Periods)
**Scenario**: Full 3-day Tokyo itinerary with all time periods populated

### 2. Minimal Itinerary (Many Null Periods)
**Scenario**: 2-day Kyoto itinerary with many null time periods

### 3. Edge Case (Very Long Text)
**Scenario**: 1-day Paris itinerary with extremely long descriptions and many activities

### 4. Family Day Trip (Selective Periods)
**Scenario**: 1-day San Diego trip with selective time periods (no night/late_night)

## Responsive Breakpoints

### Desktop (1024px+)
- **Container**: Max-width 900px, centered
- **Padding**: 2rem
- **Metadata**: Flex wrap with 1.5rem gap
- **Font Sizes**: Full size (Day headers: 1.8rem, Time periods: 1.3rem, Attractions: 1.2rem)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Content centered with max-width constraint
- Metadata items wrap naturally based on content
- Ample spacing between sections
- Optimal reading width maintained

### Tablet (768px)
- **Container**: Padding reduced to 1.5rem
- **Metadata**: Gap reduced to 1rem, padding reduced to 1rem
- **Metadata Items**: Flex basis 150px
- **Font Sizes**: Reduced (Day headers: 1.5rem, Time periods: 1.15rem, Attractions: 1.1rem)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Reduced padding for narrower screens
- Maintained readability with scaled-down fonts
- Metadata items wrap earlier
- No horizontal scrolling

### Mobile (480px and below)
- **Container**: Padding reduced to 1rem
- **Metadata**: Vertical stacking (flex-direction: column)
- **Days Gap**: Reduced to 1.5rem
- **Component Padding**: Minimized across all components
- **Font Sizes**: Mobile-optimized (Day headers: 1.4rem, Time periods: 1.1rem, Attractions: 1.05rem)
- **Touch Targets**: Activity items minimum 44px height

**Expected Behavior**:
- Metadata stacks vertically for easy reading
- All padding minimized to maximize content space
- Touch targets meet accessibility standards (44px minimum)
- List items have adequate spacing for touch interaction
- No horizontal scrolling at 320px width

## Verification Checklist

### Layout Tests
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at 320px width
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at 768px width
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at 1024px+ width
- [ ] Content remains centered on large screens
- [ ] Metadata wraps appropriately at each breakpoint
- [ ] Metadata stacks vertically on mobile

### Typography Tests
- [ ] Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- [ ] Font sizes scale appropriately
- [ ] Line heights maintain readability
- [ ] Long text wraps properly without overflow
- [ ] Headings maintain visual hierarchy

### Spacing Tests
- [ ] Adequate whitespace between sections at all sizes
- [ ] Padding scales appropriately for screen size
- [ ] Gaps between elements feel balanced
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44px on mobile

### Null Handling Tests
- [ ] Null time periods don't render empty sections (minimal scenario)
- [ ] Days with mixed null/populated periods render correctly
- [ ] No errors or crashes with null values
- [ ] Visual spacing remains consistent with null periods

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Very long text wraps properly (edge case scenario)
- [ ] Many activities don't break layout (edge case scenario)
- [ ] Long attraction names wrap appropriately
- [ ] Long descriptions maintain readability

### Visual Hierarchy Tests
- [ ] Day numbers are immediately visible
- [ ] Time periods are clearly labeled
- [ ] Attraction names stand out from descriptions
- [ ] Activities and dining info are distinguishable
- [ ] Color contrast is adequate for readability

### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Touch targets meet 44px minimum on mobile
- [ ] Interactive elements are easily tappable
- [ ] Text contrast is sufficient
- [ ] Content is keyboard navigable (if applicable)

## Test Results

- Mixed null/populated periods work correctly

### Edge Cases
**Status**: PASS
- Very long text wraps properly without overflow

## Issues Found

### None
All tests passed successfully. The component handles responsive layouts correctly across all breakpoints, gracefully handles null values, and maintains visual hierarchy and scannability with various content lengths.

## Recommendations

1. **Light Mode Support**: Current implementation includes light mode styles via `prefers-color-scheme` media query, which adapts colors for light theme users

2. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding print styles for users who want to print their itineraries

3. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding export to PDF functionality

4. **Performance**: Component performs well with test data. No rendering performance issues observed.
