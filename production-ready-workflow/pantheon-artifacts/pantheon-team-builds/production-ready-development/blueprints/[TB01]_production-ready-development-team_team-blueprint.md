## Welcome to Your Blueprint Journey

Think of this file as a shared workspace that you and the specialist agents shape together. Every time you collaborate with them, each section of the blueprint will be drafted in place of a `SECTION:PLACEHOLDER` tag. Move at your own pace, review the drafts they hand back, and keep iterating until the blueprint feels like it truly represents the team you have in mind.

### Phase 1: Shape the Blueprint Together (Iterative)

This phase is all about conversations and refinement. Each interaction gives the agents more context, and each revision brings the blueprint closer to what you need. For this phase, you need to refer to the blueprint using the blueprint ID (i.e TB01).

1.  **Set the Strategy & Context**
    -   **Who to chat with:** `@pantheon-team-builder`
    -   **Try asking:** @pantheon-team-builder, create the strategy and context for a new team based on the workflow in @docs/workflows/my-new-workflow.md
    -   The agent will help bring the `Overall Strategy` and `Project Context` sections to life. Review and provide feedback to @pantheon-team-builder to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the doc directly.

2.  **Design the Artifacts**
    -   **Who to chat with:** `@artifact-designer`
    -   **Try asking:** @artifact-designer, design the artifacts for TB01 and update the team blueprint. Do not build the artifacts yet, focus on updating the team blueprint with the artifact design.
    -   The placeholders under `ARTIFACTS` will evolve into a detailed design you can react to. Review it and provide feedback to the @artifact-designer to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the doc directly.

3.  **Design the Agents**
    -   **Who to chat with:** `@agent-designer`
    -   **Try asking:** @agent-designer, design the agents for TB01 and update the team blueprint. Do not build the agents yet, focus on updating the team blueprint with the agent design.
    -   The agent architecture will gradually replace the `AGENTS` section as you iterate together. Review it and provide feedback to the @agent-designer to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the doc directly.

4.  **Create the Team Readme**
    -   **Who to chat with:** `@team-readme-writer`
    -   **Try asking:** @team-readme-writer, create the team readme based on [TB01]_production-ready-development-team_team-blueprint.md]
    -   The team-readme-writer will create a team readme. Review and provide feedback to the readme writer to update any flows or usages you'd like to change. And point to the read me to have artifact-designer and agent-designer update their relevant sections of the blueprint.

5.  **Loop, Compare, Refine**
    -   Use what the @agent-designer creates to check whether the artifacts still make sense. If anything feels off, circle back to the @artifact-designer and explore a revised idea.

6.  **Finish with the Team Profile**
    -   **Who to chat with:** `@profile-designer`
    -   **Try asking:** @profile-designer, design the team profile for the blueprint TB01
    -   Together you will turn the `PROFILE` placeholder into the configuration that ties everything together. Review it and provide feedback to the @profile-designer to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the doc directly.
    -   You do not have to use or implement any of the profiles or configs, if you prefer to keep things simple. In that case, just delete the profiles and replace with "No profiles or configs needed".

### Phase 2: Bring the Blueprint to Life (Sequential)

Once the blueprint feels complete, you can use it as a script for creating the real team package. These steps happen in order so each piece has what it needs from the previous one. For this phase, you can refer to the blueprint using the full filename (i.e. [TB01]_production-ready-development-team_team-blueprint.md])

1.  **Create the Team Profile**
    -   The profile carries shared configuration that other components lean on.
    -   Ask @profile-designer to create the team profile from @[TB01]_production-ready-development-team_team-blueprint.md

2.  **Stand Up the Agents**
    -   Agents need to exist so the later processes know who they are empowering.
    -   For each agent described here, ask @agent-designer to create the agent from the blueprint.
    -   i.e @agent-designer create the planner agent from @[TB01]_production-ready-development-team_team-blueprint.md
    -   Review it and provide feedback to the @agent-designer to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the generated agent prompt directly.

3.  **Build the Artifacts & Processes**
    -   This step turns the blueprint's core workflows into the files your team will actually run.
    -   For each artifact, request the @artifact-designer to build each artifact
    -   i.e @artifact-designer, build the master plan artifact from @[TB01]_production-ready-development-team_team-blueprint.md
    -   Review it and provide feedback to the @artifact-designer to make any updates, or make the updates yourself in the generated processes and artifact schemas and templates directly.

When you've walked through these steps, the new team package is ready for its debut.

<!-- SECTION:START:CONTEXT -->

## Project Context
updated_at: 2025-10-14 HH:MM AM PDT

This team supports software development projects where autonomous AI agents handle the majority of feature implementation, testing, and documentation work. The operator acts as a product manager and architect who defines requirements, validates quality at strategic checkpoints, and makes final shipping decisions. The workflow is designed for established codebases with existing test suites where maintaining architectural integrity across multiple AI-driven feature additions is critical. The team operates on a principle of trust-but-verify, where AI agents are given significant autonomy within tightly scoped issue boundaries, and safeguards ensure production readiness through structured evaluation phases. This approach is particularly valuable for solo technical founders or small teams who need to scale development capacity without compromising code quality or architectural vision.

### Key Concepts

**Issue-Specific PRD**: A standalone document containing all necessary context, requirements, and guidance for implementing a single feature or bug fix, explicitly excluding background information, future roadmaps, or unrelated context that could cause scope drift.

**Junior Developer Mental Model**: The framing of AI agents as capable but requiring clear guidance, complete context, and explicit boundaries to produce quality work, similar to how one would scope work for a talented but less experienced developer.

**Autonomous Phase Execution**: The pattern where AI agents work independently within a defined phase (implementation, evaluation, documentation) for 15-35 minutes without human intervention, completing all phase deliverables before returning control.

**Evaluation-Improvement Cycle**: The two-pass pattern where code is first implemented, then systematically evaluated by a specialized agent, then improved by addressing critical and medium feedback, ensuring quality before documentation.

**Architectural Integrity Review**: The systematic assessment of code changes against established architectural patterns and principles, typically performed by multiple AI reviewers on pull requests to prevent technical debt accumulation.

**Context Isolation**: The deliberate practice of providing only relevant information for the current task and explicitly instructing agents to ignore other documentation, preventing confusion and over-implementation from excessive context.

### Core Capabilities

- Transform vague issue descriptions into comprehensive, scoped PRDs through iterative refinement

- Guide autonomous implementation that stays within defined scope and requirements

- Systematically evaluate code quality, test coverage, and architectural alignment

- Iterate on implementations to address evaluation feedback before finalization

- Maintain documentation accuracy by reflecting actual implemented changes

- Consolidate multi-source AI feedback into actionable PR review summaries

- Justify implementation completeness through structured reasoning

### Key Principles

- Context isolation over comprehensive documentation - provide only what is needed for the specific task

- Autonomous execution within tightly scoped boundaries - define clear limits then trust the process

- Evaluation before finalization - never skip quality assessment even when implementation appears complete

- Structured phases over monolithic workflows - break complex work into discrete, manageable stages

- Artifact-driven accountability - every phase produces a tangible deliverable that can be reviewed

- Trust through safeguards - enable autonomy by building in systematic quality checks

- Junior developer framing - set clear expectations and provide complete context as if working with less experienced talent

## Artifact Design
updated_at: 2025-10-14 HH:MM AM PDT

### Process Architecture Overview

This team's Pantheon processes form a sequential, quality-gated workflow where each artifact builds on the previous one. The issue-specific PRD establishes scope and context isolation. The implementation evaluation report validates quality before proceeding. The PR review consolidation synthesizes external feedback into actionable improvements. Each process enforces the closed loop by accepting only Pantheon-managed artifacts as inputs, ensuring that all context, decisions, and feedback are captured within the framework rather than lost in ad-hoc communications or external tools.

### Process Interactions

The create-issue-specific-prd process produces the foundational artifact that scopes all subsequent work. The create-implementation-evaluation-report process consumes the PRD artifact to validate that implementation matches requirements. The create-pr-review-consolidation process operates independently but uses the PRD as reference context to assess whether external feedback aligns with original intent. Each GET operation retrieves artifacts for operator review or inter-process handoffs. Each UPDATE operation allows refinement based on operator feedback without leaving the Pantheon boundary. This closed loop ensures no decisions or context are lost in external communications.

### Operator Notes

The operator must manually review and refine PRDs before implementation begins, as initial issue descriptions are often vague. After implementation, the operator should run tests independently to verify pass status, even though test results are captured in evaluation reports. During PR review, the operator makes final architectural judgment calls on whether AI-suggested improvements are truly necessary or represent over-engineering. Git operations (branching, committing, merging, closing issues) remain entirely manual and outside Pantheon's automation surface. The operator performs lightweight user acceptance testing to verify features work as intended, complementing the systematic quality checks from AI evaluators.

## Agent Architecture
updated_at: 2025-10-14 HH:MM AM PDT

### Team Composition

This team consists of three specialized agents that work sequentially to support the human operator through the production-ready development workflow. The prd-specialist initiates each feature cycle by transforming vague issue descriptions into comprehensive, scoped specifications that provide complete context for autonomous implementation. After the operator executes implementation via external LLM, the code-evaluator systematically assesses code quality, test coverage, and architectural alignment, ensuring production readiness before finalization. Finally, when external AI reviewers provide PR feedback, the review-synthesizer consolidates multiple perspectives into actionable recommendations. Each agent produces or updates Pantheon artifacts that the operator reviews at strategic checkpoints. This composition enables the operator to act as product manager and architect rather than hands-on implementer, while maintaining full control over merge decisions and architectural direction.

## Team Profile Configuration
updated_at: 2025-10-14 HH:MM AM PDT

### Configuration Overview

This team operates in a single, prescriptive mode designed around the trust-but-verify autonomous development philosophy. The workflow's effectiveness depends on the tight integration of its principles: junior developer framing, context isolation, autonomous phase execution, and systematic quality gates. These principles work as a unified system rather than independent toggles. No configurable properties are defined because the three core processes (PRD generation, implementation evaluation, and PR review consolidation) are data-driven rather than mode-driven. Their schemas adapt to the artifacts they receive, not to operational profiles. Adding configuration would introduce unnecessary complexity without unlocking meaningful schema branches or template conditions. Teams adopting this blueprint should embrace the entire workflow as designed or choose a different approach.

### Profile Configuration

No configuration profiles required for this team. The team operates with a single, consistent configuration.
