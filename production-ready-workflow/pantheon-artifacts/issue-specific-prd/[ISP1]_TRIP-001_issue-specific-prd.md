## Project Context

This is a proof-of-concept travel itinerary generator designed to help travelers create personalized trip plans without hours of manual research. The application addresses decision fatigue by using AI to generate structured, day-by-day itineraries tailored to party composition, destination, and time of year. The MVP focuses on core generation functionality using a frontend-only architecture with a CLI-based API client, establishing a foundation for future migration to a production backend service.

### Key Concepts

**Party Information**: Natural language description of travel group demographics and style (e.g., 'late 20s Gen Z couple', 'family of four with 12-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl')

**Time Period**: Flexible segments of a day (morning, afternoon, evening, night, late_night) that may be included or excluded based on party type and appropriateness

**API Abstraction Layer**: Frontend code layer providing IItineraryService interface with pluggable implementations (CLIApiClient for POC, HTTPApiClient for future production)

**CLIApiClient**: POC implementation that calls 'claude -p' command directly from frontend to generate itineraries without requiring a separate backend service

**Seasonal Recommendations**: Travel suggestions that account for the month of visit, including weather-appropriate activities, seasonal events, and attraction availability

### Core Capabilities

- Generate personalized multi-day travel itineraries using AI

- Adapt recommendations based on party demographics and travel style

- Provide seasonal and weather-appropriate activity suggestions

- Structure itineraries with flexible time-of-day periods

- Store and retrieve itinerary generation history locally

- Abstract API implementation for smooth POC-to-production migration

### Key Principles

- Simplicity First: Single-page app requiring maximum 3 clicks to generate an itinerary, no registration required

- Decoupled Architecture: Frontend code independent of backend implementation through API abstraction layer

- Flexibility Over Rigidity: Time periods are optional and contextual rather than enforced for every day

- User-Centered Generation: All recommendations tailored to party composition and seasonal context

- Progressive Enhancement: POC CLI implementation establishes foundation for production HTTP implementation

## Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Approach

Build a React single-page application with a clear separation between UI components and API service layer. Implement the IItineraryService interface with CLIApiClient that executes 'claude -p' commands to generate structured JSON responses. Use React hooks for state management and local storage for history persistence. Focus on creating reusable components for the input form and itinerary display that can adapt to varying time period structures.

### Key Implementation Steps

1. Set up React project structure with components for input form, itinerary display, and history view

2. Define IItineraryService interface and implement CLIApiClient with hardcoded prompt template

3. Build input form component with destination text input, party info text input, month dropdown, and days number input

4. Implement itinerary generation logic that constructs prompt, calls CLI command, and parses JSON response

5. Create itinerary display component that renders day-by-day structure with flexible time periods

6. Add local storage integration for saving and retrieving last 10 itineraries

7. Implement loading states, error handling, and JSON schema validation

8. Apply responsive styling and ensure clear visual hierarchy for scannable itineraries

### Helpful Code Snippets

**IItineraryService interface defining the API abstraction layer:**

```typescript

interface IItineraryService {
  generateItinerary(
    destination: string,
    partyInfo: string,
    month: string,
    days: number
  ): Promise<ItineraryResponse>;
  
  getHistory(): Array<ItineraryResponse>;
  
  saveToHistory(itinerary: ItineraryResponse): void;
}

class CLIApiClient implements IItineraryService {
  async generateItinerary(
    destination: string,
    partyInfo: string,
    month: string,
    days: number
  ): Promise<ItineraryResponse> {
    const prompt = this.buildPrompt(destination, partyInfo, month, days);
    const result = await this.executeCLI(prompt);
    return this.parseResponse(result);
  }
  
  private buildPrompt(...): string {
    // Construct hardcoded prompt template with user inputs
  }
  
  private async executeCLI(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    // Execute 'claude -p "..."' command
  }
  
  private parseResponse(json: string): ItineraryResponse {
    // Parse and validate JSON against schema
  }
}

```

**JSON schema structure for itinerary response validation:**

```json

{
  "destination": "Tokyo, Japan",
  "party_info": "Late 20s Gen Z couple",
  "month": "March",
  "days": 5,
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "morning": [
        {
          "attraction": "Senso-ji Temple",
          "attraction_description": "Tokyo's oldest Buddhist temple",
          "what_to_do": ["Explore temple grounds", "Visit Nakamise shopping street"],
          "where_to_eat": "Try street food at Nakamise"
        }
      ],
      "afternoon": [...],
      "evening": [...],
      "night": null,
      "late_night": null
    }
  ]
}

```

**Local storage history management with 10-item limit:**

```typescript

const HISTORY_KEY = 'itinerary_history';
const MAX_HISTORY = 10;

function saveToHistory(itinerary: ItineraryResponse): void {
  const history = getHistory();
  history.unshift(itinerary);
  
  if (history.length > MAX_HISTORY) {
    history.pop();
  }
  
  localStorage.setItem(HISTORY_KEY, JSON.stringify(history));
}

function getHistory(): Array<ItineraryResponse> {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem(HISTORY_KEY);
  return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
}

```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Hardcoding time periods for every day instead of making them flexible based on party type and context

- Tightly coupling frontend to CLI implementation rather than using the API abstraction layer

- Failing to validate JSON responses against schema, leading to UI rendering errors

- Overcomplicating the POC by implementing Phase 2/3 features like budget preferences or map integration

- Not handling CLI command failures or timeouts gracefully in the user interface

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can input destination, party info, month, and days then click 'Generate Itinerary' to receive a personalized plan

- [ ] Generated itineraries display day-by-day structure with time periods (morning, afternoon, evening, etc.) showing attractions, descriptions, activities, and dining

- [ ] Time periods are flexibly included based on appropriateness (e.g., families may not have late_night activities)

- [ ] Seasonal context influences recommendations (e.g., March cherry blossoms in Tokyo, December holiday markets in Europe)

- [ ] Application stores last 10 generated itineraries locally and displays them in a history view

- [ ] Itinerary generation completes within 30 seconds with visible loading state during processing

- [ ] CLIApiClient successfully calls 'claude -p' command and parses returned JSON into itinerary structure

- [ ] Error states are displayed if generation fails or JSON parsing errors occur

### Test Requirements

**Minimum Test Coverage:** All React components must have unit tests verifying rendering and user interactions. CLIApiClient must have integration tests mocking CLI command execution. JSON schema validation must be tested with both valid and invalid response structures. Local storage operations must be tested for save/retrieve/limit enforcement. Minimum 75% code coverage for core generation and display logic.

**Required Tests:**

- Input form validates trip duration is between 1-30 days and all required fields are populated

- CLIApiClient constructs correct prompt template with user inputs and executes CLI command

- JSON response parser successfully validates against schema and handles malformed responses

- Itinerary display component renders day-by-day structure with varying time period configurations

- Local storage correctly saves itineraries and enforces 10-item history limit

- Loading state displays during generation and clears when complete or on error

- History view retrieves and displays previously generated itineraries with correct metadata

- Seasonal prompt variations produce contextually appropriate recommendations for different months

### Manual Verification Steps

1. Generate an itinerary for a family with young children and verify no late_night activities are included

2. Generate itineraries for the same destination in different months and confirm seasonal variation in recommendations

3. Create 12 itineraries and verify only the last 10 are retained in history

4. Test with various party descriptions (solo traveler, couple, family, group) and verify recommendations adapt appropriately

5. Verify the generated itinerary displays clearly with proper visual hierarchy and is easy to scan
