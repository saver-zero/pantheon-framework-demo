> I am thinking of creating a receipt-analyzer team. I'll give it a set of receipt         
images and ask it to analyze it - grocery receipts, amazon receipts, things of that        
nature where you don't really get visibility into your spending just from a credit card    
 statement. What kind of analysis would be useful and helpful? 

● Great project idea! Receipt-level data reveals spending patterns that credit card        
  statements completely miss. Here are some analyses that would be particularly
  valuable:

  High-Value Analyses

  1. Item-Level Category Intelligence
  - Break down purchases by actual product categories (produce, cleaning supplies,
  snacks, etc.) rather than just "Grocery Store"
  - Track specific items over time to spot price changes and buying patterns
  - Identify which stores are cheapest for items you buy regularly

  2. Budget Leak Detection
  - Find "invisible" spending - $3-$15 purchases that happen frequently and add up
  - Track impulse purchases (items not on typical shopping lists)
  - Identify subscription-worthy items (buying individually when bulk/subscription
  would save money)

  3. Household Economics
  - Estimated cost per meal/person
  - Ratio of dining out vs. groceries vs. meal kits
  - Fresh vs. processed food spending (health insights)
  - Waste indicators (frequent small purchases of same item vs. better bulk buying)

  4. Tax & Expense Optimization
  - Auto-extract business expenses across mixed-use receipts
  - Medical/FSA eligible items
  - Sales tax paid (useful for tax deductions in some states)

  5. Receipt Validation & Fraud Detection
  - Match receipt totals to credit card charges (catch overcharges)
  - Track promotions/discounts actually applied
  - Flag duplicate charges

  6. Time-Based Insights
  - Spending velocity (how quickly you go through budgets)
  - Seasonal patterns and holiday spending spikes
  - Day-of-week patterns (expensive weekday lunches, weekend splurges)

  7. Smart Alerts
  - Return windows closing for expensive items
  - Warranty information extraction
  - Price drops on items you buy regularly

  The real power would be in comparative analysis - showing "You spent $127 on coffee
  shops this month, but only $45 on coffee beans - that's a potential $1,000/year
  savings" or "Target charged you 30% more for paper towels than Costco."

  What type of receipts are you most interested in analyzing initially?

> that's a bit too much. The category breakdown seems useful though. what about a 
markdown overview report of the receipts analyzed - just something easy to read to get     
a high level feel for what's going on, not too long or technical. and maybe include a      
couple tips or suggestions on ways to save? let's keep it simple and approachable 

● That's much better - keeping it simple and actionable! A clean markdown report with:     

  1. Quick Summary Stats
    - Total spent across all receipts
    - Number of receipts analyzed
    - Date range covered
  2. Category Breakdown
    - Spending by category with percentages
    - Maybe a simple text-based visual (like bar chart with characters)
  3. Notable Patterns
    - Most expensive single purchase
    - Most frequent store
    - Average transaction size
  4. 2-3 Practical Tips
    - Based on actual patterns found (e.g., "You bought coffee 8 times this month at $5    
   average - brewing at home could save ~$35/month")
    - Keep it conversational, not preachy

  The whole report could be under 50 lines - something you'd actually want to read. No     
  complex charts, no overwhelming detail, just "here's what happened with your money       
  and here's a couple easy wins."

  Would you like help designing the Pantheon team structure for this? Or are you
  looking to brainstorm more about what the report should look like first?

> yes let's design the team 

● I'll invoke the Pantheon team builder specialist to help design this receipt analyzer    
   team.

● pantheon-team-builder(Design receipt analyzer team)
  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 24.9k tokens · 1m 11s)

● Perfect! The receipt analysis team blueprint has been created as TB02.

  What Was Created

  The blueprint establishes a focused mission: transform receipt images into simple,       
  actionable spending insights through conversational markdown reports.

  Core Design:
  - 3 Key Artifacts: Spending Insights Report, Receipt Data Extraction Spec, and
  Category Mapping Guide
  - 6 Guiding Principles: Simplicity over completeness, conversational over technical,
  actionable over academic, etc.
  - 4 Strategic Goals: Clear spending visibility, actionable tips, approachable format,
   and informed decision-making

  Next Steps

  You can now work iteratively with specialist agents to design the team:

  1. @artifact-designer - Design the artifacts (report format, data structures,
  category mapping)
  2. @agent-designer - Design the agents that will extract data and generate insights      
  3. @team-readme-writer - Create user-facing documentation
  4. @profile-designer - Set up the team profile and configs

  The blueprint is at:
  pantheon-artifacts/pantheon-team-builds/receipt-analysis/blueprints/[TB01]_receipt-an    
  alysis_team-blueprint.md

  Would you like to start designing the artifacts, or would you prefer to review the       
  blueprint first?

● artifact-designer(Design artifacts for TB01)
  ⎿  Done (7 tool uses · 29.3k tokens · 1m 14s)

● Perfect! The artifact design is complete for TB01.

  What Was Designed

  Single Artifact: Spending Insights Report
  - Simple, conversational markdown report (under 50 lines)
  - 4 sections: quick stats, category breakdown, notable patterns, and actionable tips     
  - CREATE and GET operations
  - Complete build mode (generated atomically, not incrementally)

  The design is streamlined and casual, exactly as you requested - no separate data
  extraction specs or mapping guides, just the final report.

  Next Steps

  You can now continue with:
  - @agent-designer - Design the agents that will analyze receipts and create reports
  - @team-readme-writer - Create user-facing documentation
  - @profile-designer - Set up team profile and configs

  Or you can review the artifact design in the blueprint first if you'd like to make       
  any adjustments.

  What would you like to do next?

  > @agent-designer - Design the agents that will analyze receipts and create reports        

● I'll invoke the agent-designer specialist to design the agents for TB01.

● agent-designer(Design agents for TB01)
  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 23.9k tokens · 1m 7s)

● Excellent! The agent design is complete for TB01.

  What Was Designed

  Single Agent: receipt-helper
  - Acts as a personal spending analyst
  - Analyzes receipt images and extracts transaction data
  - Categorizes purchases, calculates stats, identifies patterns
  - Generates 2-3 actionable money-saving tips
  - Produces the complete Spending Insights Report in conversational tone

  Primary Workflow:
  - create-spending-insights-report - Generates complete report from receipt images

  The design keeps it simple with a single agent that handles everything from image
  analysis to report generation, matching your goal of keeping things approachable and
  casual.

  Next Steps

  You can now continue with:
  - @team-readme-writer - Create user-facing documentation explaining how to use the       
  team
  - @profile-designer - Set up team profile and configs

  Or review the agent design in the blueprint if you'd like to make adjustments.

  What would you like to do next?

> @team-readme-writer - Create user-facing documentation explaining how to use the         
  
  team 

● I'll invoke the team-readme-writer specialist to create user-facing documentation for    
   TB01.

● team-readme-writer(Create README for TB01)
  ⎿  Done (8 tool uses · 38.6k tokens · 2m 26s)

● Perfect! The team README has been created for TB01.

  What Was Created

  File: pantheon-artifacts/pantheon-team-builds/receipt-analysis/team-readme/[TR1]_rece    
  ipt-analysis-team_team-readme.md

  Key Sections:
  - Overview with mission and use cases
  - Getting Started guide for new users
  - Working with Agents section explaining the receipt-helper
  - Understanding Team Artifacts documenting the Spending Insights Report
  - Workflow Examples with 3 practical scenarios (monthly review, multi-store
  comparison, quick analysis)

  The README is written in a conversational, approachable style focused on natural
  language interaction - no technical commands, just friendly guidance on how to talk
  to the agents and what to expect.

  Next Steps

  The final design phase is:
  - @profile-designer - Set up team profile and configs

  After that, the team blueprint will be complete and ready for implementation (Phase      
  2). Would you like to continue with the profile designer?

> @profile-designer - Set up team profile and configs 

● I'll invoke the profile-designer specialist to set up the team profile and configs       
  for TB01.

● profile-designer(Design profile and configs for TB01)
  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 22.2k tokens · 51.6s)

● Perfect! The profile design is complete for TB01.

  What Was Decided

  No Configuration Required - The profile-designer determined that the receipt-analysis    
   team doesn't need any configurable properties because:
  - Fixed output format (conversational markdown, under 50 lines)
  - Consistent structure (same 4 sections every time)
  - Single tone (always conversational and friendly)
  - Clear constraints (2-3 tips, 2-minute read time)

  Adding configuration would introduce unnecessary complexity without providing value,
  which would violate the team's core principle of "simplicity over completeness."

  Phase 1 Complete! 🎉

  The design phase for TB01 is now complete with all sections finished:
  - ✅ Foundation & Context (team-builder)
  - ✅ Artifacts (artifact-designer)
  - ✅ Agents (agent-designer)
  - ✅ Team README (team-readme-writer)
  - ✅ Profile & Configs (profile-designer)

  Next: Phase 2 - Implementation

  You can now move to building the actual team by working with specialist agents to:       
  1. Build artifacts - Create the actual artifact files/templates
  2. Create agents - Implement the receipt-helper agent
  3. Build routines - Create the workflows (like create-spending-insights-report)

  Would you like to start Phase 2 implementation, or would you prefer to review the        
  complete blueprint first?

  > Have @profile-designer create the team profile from 
@[TB01]_receipt-analysis_team-blueprint.md and @agent-designer create the agents from

● Excellent! All three Phase 2 implementation tasks completed successfully in parallel.    
   Here's what was created:

  1. Team Profile ✅

  File: pantheon-artifacts/pantheon-team-builds/receipt-analysis/team-profile.yaml
  - Team name: receipt-analysis
  - No configuration properties (as designed - single operational mode)
  - Ready for use

  2. Agent Created ✅

  File: pantheon-artifacts/pantheon-team-builds/receipt-analysis/agents/[AD1]_receipt-h
  elper.md
  - Agent ID: AD1
  - Role: Personal spending analyst
  - 5 core competencies including receipt image analysis, categorization, and pattern
  detection
  - 5 philosophy principles aligned with the blueprint
  - CREATE workflow for generating spending insights reports

  3. Artifacts & Processes Built ✅

  Artifact: spending-insights-report with 4 sections (quick_stats, category_breakdown,
  notable_patterns, actionable_tips)

  27 Files Generated across 3 process families:
  - create-spending-insights-report - Generates new reports from receipt images
  - get-spending-insights-report - Retrieves existing reports by ID
  - update-spending-insights-report - Updates individual sections

  All templates enforce the conversational tone and under-50-lines constraint.

  Team Status

  The receipt-analysis team (TB01) is now fully implemented and ready to use! All Phase    
   2 components are in place:
  - ✅ Team profile
  - ✅ Agent (receipt-helper)
  - ✅ Artifacts & processes

  You can now start using the team to analyze receipt images and generate spending
  insights reports. Would you like to test it out with some sample receipts?

  > @agent-artifact-designer let's update the guidance and description for 
@pantheon-teams\receipt-analysis\processes\update-spending-insights-report\artifact\sec    
tions\category_breakdown.schema.jsonnet . The category should be more granular for -       
groceries is too generic, i'd like to know a bit more - was it meat? vegetable? dairy?     
what TYPE of grocery was it? i don't want it TOO detailed (i.e. organic chicken 
drumsticks) but i need to know what type it is.  @agent-agent-designer also update         
@pantheon-teams\receipt-analysis\agents\[AD1]_receipt-helper.md so that it doesn't do      
generic category. both agents should make direct updates to the files 
  ⎿ Read pantheon-teams\receipt-analysis\processes\update-spending-insights-report\artifact
    \sections\category_breakdown.schema.jsonnet (41 lines)
  ⎿  Read pantheon-teams\receipt-analysis\agents\[AD1]_receipt-helper.md (100 lines)       

● I'll invoke both specialist agents to update the files for more granular grocery
  categorization.

● agent-designer(Update receipt-helper agent)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 23.0k tokens · 1m 28s)

● Perfect! Both agents have successfully updated the files. Here's what changed:

  Category Breakdown Schema Updated

  File: category_breakdown.schema.jsonnet

  The schema now:
  - Explicitly prohibits generic "Groceries" category
  - Provides 9 granular grocery subcategories:
    - Fresh Produce (vegetables, fruits)
    - Meat & Seafood
    - Dairy & Eggs
    - Bakery
    - Beverages
    - Snacks & Sweets
    - Pantry Staples
    - Frozen Foods
    - Health & Personal Care
  - Maintains balance: Specific enough to reveal patterns without getting into
  individual product names
  - Still targets 3-6 categories overall while allowing meaningful grocery breakdowns

  Receipt-Helper Agent Updated

  File: [AD1]_receipt-helper.md

  Enhanced in three key areas:

  1. Core Competencies: Now emphasizes "Granular Spending Categorization" that breaks
  down groceries by type
  2. Approach & Philosophy: Added concrete examples showing how "40% on meat, 25% on
  beverages" is better than "65% on groceries"
  3. New Technical Section: "Granular Categorization as a Quality Requirement" with
  NEVER/ALWAYS rules making it clear that generic categories are considered a failure

  Both files now work together to ensure spending insights reveal actionable patterns
  like "You're spending heavily on prepared foods vs ingredients" rather than hiding
  those insights behind a generic "Groceries" label.
