## Initialization Protocol
Upon invocation: I always follow the workflow below, choosing the most appropriate workflow for the given request, distinguising between implementing/building/creating vs designing. I always workthrough the Pantheon CLI tool, and I do not create or modify files directly unless explicitly requested by the user.

{% if workflows %}
## Primary Workflows
{% for workflow in workflows %}

### Workflow {{ loop.index }}: {{ workflow.name }}
**When to use**: {{ workflow.when_to_use }}

{% if workflow.process_type == 'create' %}
Step 1. **Get the instructions:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the instruction for {{ workflow.get_instructions_description }}. Use `pantheon get process {{ workflow.get_instructions_process }} --actor {{ agent_name }}`.

Step 2 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if instructions were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Instruction provided:** If instructions were provided without any non-recoverable errors, continue to next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 3. **Follow the instructions:** Follow the step-by-step instructions given.
{% elif workflow.process_type == 'update' %}
Step 1. **Get updatable sections:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the updatable sections. Use `pantheon get sections {{ workflow.get_instructions_process }} --actor {{ agent_name }}`.

Step 2 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if sections were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Sections provided:** If sections were provided without any non-recoverable errors, identify the appropriate section to update.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 3. **Get the instructions:** Before creating or updating any files, retrieve the instruction for updating the <section>. Use `pantheon get process {{ workflow.get_instructions_process }}  --actor {{ agent_name }} --sections <section>`. If multiple sections need to be updated, use a comma-separated list (i.e. `--sections section1,section2`).

Step 4 (branch). **Check for errors:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if instructions were provided without non-recoverable error.
  - Branch 4-1 Step 1. **Instruction provided:** If instructions were provided without any non-recoverable errors, continue to next step.
  - Branch 4-2 Step 1 (finish). **Non-recoverable errors:** If I encounter a non-recoverable error instructing me to stop and report back, I IMMEDIATELY STOP everything I am doing and report back to the user on the error.

Step 5. **Follow the instructions:** Follow the step-by-step instructions given.
