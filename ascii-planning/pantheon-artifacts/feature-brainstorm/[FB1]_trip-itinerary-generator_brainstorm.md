## Problem Space

**Feature**: trip-itinerary-generator

### Current Pain Points

Travelers currently face significant friction when planning multi-day trips. They must manually research attractions across multiple websites, guidebooks, and forums, leading to decision fatigue. The process requires understanding which activities are suitable for their specific group composition (families with children, couples, solo travelers), determining appropriate timing and sequencing of activities, and identifying dining options that align with their location and schedule. Seasonal considerations add another layer of complexity as travelers need to account for weather, seasonal events, and attraction closures that vary by month. This manual research process is time-intensive and often results in suboptimal itineraries that don't fully consider the party's demographics or seasonal opportunities. First-time visitors to destinations are particularly disadvantaged as they lack local knowledge to make informed decisions efficiently.

### User Needs

Travelers need to quickly generate structured, personalized itineraries without spending hours on research. They need itineraries that account for their party composition so activities are age-appropriate and match their travel style (Gen Z couple vs family with children vs solo millennial). They need seasonal awareness so recommendations reflect weather conditions, seasonal events, and attraction availability for their specific travel month. They need clear day-by-day structure with logical time-of-day groupings that include both what to see and where to eat. They need the ability to reference previously generated itineraries for repeat planning or modifications. They need confidence that the generated plan is practical and considers their specific context rather than generic tourist advice.

## Project Context

A travel itinerary generator that helps travelers plan personalized day-by-day schedules. The project aims to solve the problem of time-consuming trip planning by providing AI-generated itineraries based on destination, party composition, travel month, and trip duration. This is a proof-of-concept MVP focused on delivering value quickly without requiring user accounts or complex infrastructure. The system needs to generate structured, season-appropriate itineraries with attraction recommendations, dining suggestions, and time-of-day organization while maintaining simplicity and speed.

### Key Concepts

**Party Information**: Natural language description of travel group demographics and characteristics (e.g., 'late 20s Gen Z couple', 'family with 12-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl'). Used to tailor activity recommendations to group composition and travel style.

**Time Period**: Flexible segments of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Late Night) that organize activities. Not all time periods are used for every day or party type - they adapt based on appropriateness for the group.

**Seasonal Recommendations**: Activity and attraction suggestions that account for the specific month of travel, considering weather conditions, seasonal events, and attraction operating schedules.

**API Abstraction Layer**: A pluggable interface layer in the frontend that allows seamless switching between CLI-based POC implementation (calling 'claude -p' directly) and future HTTP-based production backend without changing frontend code.

**Local History**: Browser-based storage of the last 10 generated itineraries, enabling quick reference without requiring user accounts or server-side storage.

### Core Capabilities

- Generate personalized travel itineraries based on destination, party composition, travel month, and trip duration

- Structure itineraries into day-by-day breakdown with flexible time periods

- Provide attraction recommendations with descriptions, activities, and dining suggestions

- Account for seasonal considerations and weather-appropriate activities

- Store and retrieve previously generated itineraries locally

- Switch between CLI-based POC and HTTP-based production backends transparently

### Key Principles

- Simplicity First: Maximum 3 clicks to generate an itinerary, no registration required, single-page application

- Problem-Space-First: Understand current pain points and user needs before jumping to implementation details

- Personalization Through Natural Language: Accept party information in flexible natural language rather than rigid form fields

- Seasonal Awareness: All recommendations must consider the specific month of travel for relevance

- Frontend Decoupling: API abstraction layer enables smooth migration from POC to production without frontend code changes

- Speed and Responsiveness: Itinerary generation within 10-30 seconds with clear loading states

## System Context

### Existing System Constraints

This is a frontend-only POC implementation with no backend infrastructure initially. The development team is working on a proof-of-concept timeline with the goal of validating the concept quickly. The MVP must work without user authentication or accounts, limiting storage to browser-based local storage for history. The initial implementation uses a CLI command ('claude -p') for AI generation, which means the POC requires the Claude CLI to be installed locally. The itinerary generation is dependent on AI response quality and timing, with a target of 10-30 seconds but no guaranteed SLA. The system must store only the last 10 itineraries due to local storage constraints. The MVP excludes booking integrations, real-time pricing, user reviews, social sharing, mobile apps, multi-language support, and in-app editing of generated itineraries. The technical approach must provide a migration path to a production HTTP-based backend while maintaining the same frontend interface.

### Integration Points

The frontend integrates with the Claude CLI tool via shell execution for the POC phase, passing structured prompts and receiving JSON responses. The API abstraction layer defines an IItineraryService interface with methods for generateItinerary, getHistory, and saveToHistory. The CLIApiClient implementation calls 'claude -p' with hardcoded prompt templates that include destination, party info, month, and days, expecting a JSON response conforming to a specific schema. The HTTPApiClient (future) will call REST API endpoints with the same interface contract. The frontend uses browser LocalStorage API to persist the last 10 itineraries as JSON objects. The system does not integrate with external booking services, map providers, or payment systems in the MVP scope. The prompt template and JSON schema are hardcoded in the frontend for the POC, providing explicit structure for AI-generated responses.

## Collaborative Ideas

### Exploration Round 1

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-14 HH:MM PM PDT

**AI Suggestions**:

I suggest exploring three distinct architectural approaches for the MVP implementation:

1. CLI-First Development with Abstraction Layer: Build the frontend with the IItineraryService interface immediately, implementing CLIApiClient first. This allows rapid prototyping and testing of the user experience without backend infrastructure. The abstraction layer ensures frontend code remains unchanged when migrating to HTTPApiClient. Trade-off: The POC requires local Claude CLI installation, limiting initial user testing to developers, but enables fastest time-to-validation.

2. Mock-First Development: Start with a MockApiClient that returns hardcoded sample itineraries, allowing pure frontend development and UI/UX refinement independent of AI generation. Add CLIApiClient once frontend is stable. Trade-off: Delays real AI integration testing but enables parallel frontend/backend work and comprehensive UI development without AI dependencies.

3. Hybrid Approach with Progressive Enhancement: Implement both MockApiClient and CLIApiClient from day one with a configuration toggle. Start with mock data for rapid iteration, switch to CLI for real testing, then migrate to HTTP for production. Trade-off: More initial setup complexity but maximum flexibility during development and testing.

For the itinerary generation quality, consider whether the hardcoded prompt template should include example outputs to guide AI response format, or rely solely on the JSON schema. Examples improve consistency but increase prompt length and generation time.

For the history feature, consider whether to store only the generated itinerary JSON or also include generation metadata (timestamp, generation duration, error states) to enable future analytics and debugging.
