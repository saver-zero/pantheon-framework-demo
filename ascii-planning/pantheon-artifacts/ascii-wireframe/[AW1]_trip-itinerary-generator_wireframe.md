### Layout Notes

The interface is a single-page application with three main display states: input form state (initial), loading state (during generation), and results state (after generation). The HistorySidebar remains visible across all states on the left side, occupying approximately 20% of viewport width. The main content area (80% width) shows either InputForm, LoadingState, ErrorState, or GeneratedItinerary. The GeneratedItinerary component contains scrollable DayCard components arranged vertically. On mobile viewports (< 768px), the HistorySidebar collapses into a dropdown accessible via hamburger menu. The InputForm uses responsive grid layout with fields stacking vertically on mobile. The LoadingState shows animated progress bar with status messages. The Party Info field accepts multi-line natural language text and expands to show full content. Time period sections within DayCards only render if they contain activities - not all time periods appear for every day or party type.

## Project Context

A travel itinerary generator that helps travelers plan personalized day-by-day schedules. The project aims to solve the problem of time-consuming trip planning by providing AI-generated itineraries based on destination, party composition, travel month, and trip duration. This is a proof-of-concept MVP focused on delivering value quickly without requiring user accounts or complex infrastructure. The system needs to generate structured, season-appropriate itineraries with attraction recommendations, dining suggestions, and time-of-day organization while maintaining simplicity and speed.

### Key Concepts

**Party Information**: Natural language description of travel group demographics and characteristics (e.g., 'late 20s Gen Z couple', 'family with 12-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl'). Used to tailor activity recommendations to group composition and travel style.

**Time Period**: Flexible segments of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Late Night) that organize activities. Not all time periods are used for every day or party type - they adapt based on appropriateness for the group.

**Seasonal Recommendations**: Activity and attraction suggestions that account for the specific month of travel, considering weather conditions, seasonal events, and attraction operating schedules.

**API Abstraction Layer**: A pluggable interface layer in the frontend that allows seamless switching between CLI-based POC implementation (calling 'claude -p' directly) and future HTTP-based production backend without changing frontend code.

**Local History**: Browser-based storage of the last 10 generated itineraries, enabling quick reference without requiring user accounts or server-side storage.

### Core Capabilities

- Generate personalized travel itineraries based on destination, party composition, travel month, and trip duration

- Structure itineraries into day-by-day breakdown with flexible time periods

- Provide attraction recommendations with descriptions, activities, and dining suggestions

- Account for seasonal considerations and weather-appropriate activities

- Store and retrieve previously generated itineraries locally

- Switch between CLI-based POC and HTTP-based production backends transparently

### Key Principles

- Simplicity First: Maximum 3 clicks to generate an itinerary, no registration required, single-page application

- Problem-Space-First: Understand current pain points and user needs before jumping to implementation details

- Personalization Through Natural Language: Accept party information in flexible natural language rather than rigid form fields

- Seasonal Awareness: All recommendations must consider the specific month of travel for relevance

- Frontend Decoupling: API abstraction layer enables smooth migration from POC to production without frontend code changes

- Speed and Responsiveness: Itinerary generation within 10-30 seconds with clear loading states

### State Transitions

InputForm State: Initial state on page load. Form fields are empty and editable. 'Generate Itinerary' button is disabled until all required fields (destination, party info, travel month, days) are filled. Button becomes enabled when validation passes.

Loading State: Triggered when 'Generate Itinerary' button is clicked. InputForm is replaced by LoadingState component showing animated progress bar and status message ('Generating your itinerary...', 'Analyzing seasonal activities...'). HistorySidebar remains visible but interaction is disabled. State persists for 10-30 seconds during AI generation.

Success State: After successful generation, LoadingState is replaced by GeneratedItinerary component showing structured day-by-day itinerary. Generated itinerary is automatically added to HistorySidebar at the top. HistorySidebar re-enables interaction. User can scroll through itinerary or click history items to load previous itineraries.

Error State: If generation fails (timeout, API error, invalid response), LoadingState is replaced by ErrorState component showing error message and 'Retry' button. Clicking 'Retry' returns to InputForm state with previous inputs preserved.

History Load State: When user clicks an item in HistorySidebar, current main content is replaced by that itinerary's GeneratedItinerary view. No loading animation is shown since data is already in local storage. The selected history item is highlighted in the sidebar.

<!-- SECTION:START:DESIGN_DECISIONS -->

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-14 HH:MM PM PDT

**Decision**: Single-page application with state-based main content area and persistent sidebar

**Rationale**: The brainstorm artifact emphasizes 'Simplicity First' with maximum 3 clicks to generate an itinerary and no registration required. A single-page application eliminates navigation friction and keeps the entire workflow visible in one view. The persistent HistorySidebar enables quick access to the last 10 itineraries without page reloads, supporting the local history capability. This layout supports the CLI-first development approach by centralizing all API interactions through state transitions in one component rather than distributing them across multiple pages. The state-based main content area (InputForm, LoadingState, ErrorState, GeneratedItinerary) provides clear visual feedback during the 10-30 second generation process and handles error cases gracefully. This structure maps directly to the API abstraction layer concept - the main content area consumes IItineraryService methods while remaining agnostic to CLI vs HTTP implementation.

**Alternatives Considered**: Multi-page application with separate routes: A traditional multi-page app with /new, /loading, /itinerary routes was considered but rejected because it adds unnecessary complexity for a 3-click workflow and requires client-side routing configuration. Page transitions would interrupt the generation process visual feedback and complicate history loading interactions. Modal-based workflow: Displaying the generated itinerary in a modal overlay was considered but rejected because the itinerary content is lengthy (multi-day cards with descriptions) and needs full-screen vertical scrolling space. Modals would constrain content visibility and create awkward scrolling-within-scrolling patterns. Split-screen persistent input form: Keeping the input form visible alongside generated itineraries was considered but rejected because it consumes valuable horizontal space that's needed for itinerary content on smaller screens, and the form is not needed once generation completes.
