## Clarifying Questions

**Feature**: trip-itinerary-generator-input-form-fix

**Source Wireframe**: AW1

### Questions for Operator

1. Should the InputForm remain visible simultaneously with GeneratedItinerary (split-screen approach), or should there be an explicit 'New Itinerary' button that transitions back to input-only view?
- new itinerary button

2. When user clicks 'New Itinerary' or returns to input state, should the form fields be cleared completely, or should they retain the previous values to enable quick modifications?
- retain previous values

3. Should the 'New Itinerary' action (if using button approach) clear the currently displayed itinerary from the main content area, or should it keep the last itinerary visible until a new one is generated?
- keep it visible until new one is generated

4. When loading an itinerary from HistorySidebar while in input state, should the form fields auto-populate with that itinerary's parameters to enable editing and regeneration?
- do not auto populate

5. If using split-screen approach with form always visible, should the form be positioned above the itinerary (vertical stack) or beside it (horizontal split), and how should this respond to mobile viewports?
- not split screen

6. Should there be visual indication that the form is still interactive when an itinerary is displayed (e.g., border highlight, different background), or rely on standard form affordances?
- standard form affordances

7. When an itinerary is being loaded from history, should the form fields update to show that itinerary's input parameters for reference and potential re-generation?
- no, not updated

8. Should the loading state (LoadingState component) hide the input form during generation, or allow the form to remain visible but disabled?
- remain visible but disabled

9. Are there any performance concerns with keeping InputForm mounted and visible at all times, particularly regarding form validation re-rendering?
- no

10. Should the history sidebar selection state be cleared when user initiates a new itinerary generation, or should the most recently generated item remain highlighted?
- cleared

## Project Context

The trip itinerary generator is a single-page application that allows travelers to generate personalized day-by-day trip schedules. A critical bug has been identified where the input form (InputForm component) disappears after successfully generating an itinerary, leaving users unable to generate additional itineraries without refreshing the browser. This violates the wireframe specification which shows the form should remain accessible throughout the user session. The wireframe flow diagram explicitly shows a return path from GeneratedItinerary back to InputForm, and the layout notes describe the interface as having multiple display states while maintaining consistent navigation capabilities. This fix ensures users can generate multiple itineraries in a single session as intended by the original design, supporting the 'Simplicity First' principle of maximum 3 clicks per itinerary generation.

### Key Concepts

**Persistent Input Access Pattern**: UI design pattern where primary input mechanisms remain accessible throughout the application session, even after successful operations complete. Prevents users from being trapped in result states without ability to perform new operations.

**State-Based Visibility Control**: React pattern using conditional rendering based on application state (INPUT, LOADING, SUCCESS, ERROR) to show/hide components. The current implementation uses exclusive state rendering (only one state visible), but the wireframe requires additive rendering (multiple states visible simultaneously).

**New Itinerary Trigger**: User action that returns the application to input-ready state, clearing current itinerary view and preparing for new generation request. Can be implemented as explicit button ('New Itinerary') or implicit action (making form always visible).

**Flow Diagram Return Path**: Visual specification in wireframe showing navigation from GeneratedItinerary state back to InputForm state (lines 173-174 of wireframe). Indicates users must be able to return to input after viewing results without browser refresh.

### Core Capabilities

- Restore input form visibility after successful itinerary generation

- Enable users to generate multiple itineraries in single session without page refresh

- Provide clear navigation mechanism to return from results view to input state

- Maintain form data persistence between generations for easy modification

- Preserve history sidebar functionality while transitioning between states

### Key Principles

- Wireframe Compliance: Every UI behavior must match the approved wireframe specification, including flow diagrams and state transitions

- Multi-Generation Support: Users should be able to generate unlimited itineraries in one session without external intervention

- Simplicity First: Maintain the 3-click maximum principle - adding 'New Itinerary' button should not increase interaction complexity

- State Clarity: User should always understand current application state and available actions

- Data Persistence: Form values should be preserved to allow quick modifications rather than forcing full re-entry

## Backend Architecture

### API Endpoints

[{'method': 'POST', 'path': '/api/itinerary/generate', 'purpose': 'Generates a new personalized travel itinerary based on destination, party information, travel month, and trip duration. Called when user submits InputForm with valid data.', 'request_format': '{ destination: string, partyInfo: string, travelMonth: string (month name), days: integer (1-7) }', 'response_format': '{ itineraryMarkdown: string, generationDuration: number (milliseconds), timestamp: ISO8601 string }'}]

### Business Logic

The core business logic for this fix centers on state management and component visibility control. The application currently uses exclusive state rendering where only one main content component (InputForm, LoadingState, ErrorState, or GeneratedItinerary) is visible at a time based on appState enum value. The fix requires modifying this logic to support either: (1) simultaneous rendering of InputForm and GeneratedItinerary in SUCCESS state, or (2) adding explicit state transition from SUCCESS back to INPUT via user action.

If using the button approach (Option 2), a new handler function handleNewItinerary must be added to App.jsx that transitions appState from SUCCESS to INPUT. This handler should optionally clear or preserve formData state based on UX decision from clarifying question #2. The handler should also clear currentItinerary state to remove the displayed results.

If using the simultaneous rendering approach (Option 1), the conditional rendering logic in App.jsx must be modified from 'appState === AppState.SUCCESS' to include InputForm rendering when in SUCCESS state. The layout must switch from single-column to stacked or split layout. CSS classes must be updated to handle this dual-component rendering.

Both approaches require validation that form submission during SUCCESS state properly transitions to LOADING state and eventually returns to SUCCESS with new itinerary. The history sidebar interaction (handleSelectItinerary) must be reviewed to ensure it doesn't conflict with the new form visibility logic. Specifically, when a history item is clicked while in INPUT state, the decision must be made whether to populate form fields with that itinerary's parameters (see question #4) or simply display the itinerary while keeping the form independent.

Form state persistence logic must be reviewed to ensure initialValues prop continues to work correctly when transitioning between states. The formData state in App.jsx is already preserved across state transitions, but the interaction between this preserved data and the new visibility pattern must be validated to prevent edge cases where stale data is submitted.

### Service Integration

The fix does not require new external service integration. The existing CLIApiClient.generateItinerary integration point remains unchanged. The LocalStorageService integration for saving and retrieving itineraries is not affected by this UI state management fix. However, if clarifying question #4 is answered affirmatively (form should auto-populate from history selection), a new integration point is needed where handleSelectItinerary callback in App.jsx updates formData state with the selected itinerary's input parameters (destination, partyInfo, travelMonth, days). This would require accessing these fields from the itinerary object structure stored in LocalStorage.

## Database Design

### Schema Changes

No database schema changes required. This is a frontend-only UI state management fix that does not affect data persistence structures.

### Data Migrations

No data migrations required. Local storage structure for itinerary history remains unchanged.

### Data Integrity

No data integrity considerations required. This fix does not modify data structures or persistence logic.

## UI Implementation

### Component Mapping

[{'friendly_id': 'InputForm', 'implementation_notes': "React functional component with form state management. CHANGE REQUIRED: Modify visibility logic in App.jsx to render InputForm in SUCCESS state either simultaneously with GeneratedItinerary (Option 1) or via explicit 'New Itinerary' button transition (Option 2). If Option 1, add CSS classes to support stacked/split layout. Ensure isLoading prop is set to true during LOADING state to disable form interactions. If question #4 answered affirmatively, add prop to receive itinerary data for form pre-population. Component's internal validation and state management logic remains unchanged. The existing initialValues prop mechanism already supports pre-population if needed."}, {'friendly_id': 'GeneratedItinerary', 'implementation_notes': "React functional component displaying itinerary results. CHANGE REQUIRED if Option 1: Add prop or CSS class to support split-screen layout with InputForm. Update styling to constrain height and enable vertical scrolling when sharing viewport with form. If Option 2 selected, add 'New Itinerary' button as child component that calls handleNewItinerary callback prop. Button should be prominently positioned (e.g., sticky header or footer within GeneratedItinerary container). Ensure button styling follows existing design system patterns."}, {'friendly_id': 'GenerateButton', 'implementation_notes': 'Submit button within InputForm component. No changes required. Existing disabled state logic (disabled when !isFormValid() || isLoading) correctly prevents submission during generation. Verify button remains clickable when in SUCCESS state if using Option 1 simultaneous rendering approach.'}, {'friendly_id': 'HistorySidebar', 'implementation_notes': "React functional component displaying itinerary history list. No changes required to component itself. However, parent App.jsx's handleSelectItinerary callback may need modification if question #4 is answered affirmatively to update formData state alongside currentItinerary state. Review interaction between history selection and new form visibility pattern to ensure expected UX flow."}, {'friendly_id': 'LoadingState', 'implementation_notes': 'React functional component showing generation progress. CHANGE REQUIRED if question #8 answered to keep form visible during loading: Modify App.jsx conditional rendering to show both LoadingState and InputForm (with isLoading=true) simultaneously during LOADING state. Update layout CSS to position LoadingState as overlay or adjacent to disabled form. If question #8 answered to hide form during loading, no changes required - maintain existing exclusive rendering logic.'}, {'friendly_id': 'ErrorState', 'implementation_notes': 'React functional component displaying error message and retry button. No changes required. The existing handleRetry callback already transitions back to INPUT state with formData preserved, which aligns with the fix objectives.'}, {'friendly_id': 'AppHeader', 'implementation_notes': 'Static header component displaying application title. No changes required.'}]

### Style Patterns

The application uses CSS modules or CSS classes for styling. The main layout is controlled by .app-container flexbox with .history-sidebar (20% width) and .main-content (80% width). If implementing Option 1 (simultaneous rendering), new CSS classes are required:

- .main-content.split-view: Modify to use vertical flexbox or grid layout when both InputForm and GeneratedItinerary are visible. Suggest 30% height for form, 70% for itinerary on desktop.
- .input-form-container.compact: Optional class to reduce form padding/spacing when in split view to maximize itinerary viewing area.
- .generated-itinerary.scrollable: Ensure proper overflow-y: auto and max-height constraints when sharing viewport.

If implementing Option 2 (button approach), new CSS required:
- .new-itinerary-button: Primary button styling consistent with .generate-button. Position as sticky element at top or bottom of GeneratedItinerary container.
- .itinerary-header-actions: Container div for placing button in ItineraryHeader component.

Mobile viewport considerations (< 768px): If Option 1, stack form and itinerary vertically with form collapsible via accordion pattern. If Option 2, button should remain visible and easily accessible without scrolling.

Color scheme and spacing should match existing design system. Reference .generate-button styles for consistency.

### Interaction Details

If implementing Option 1 (simultaneous rendering): When user submits form, InputForm remains visible but disabled (via isLoading prop) while LoadingState appears either as overlay or in itinerary area. Upon successful generation, LoadingState is replaced by GeneratedItinerary, and form re-enables. Form fields retain submitted values to enable quick modifications. User can immediately modify form and re-submit for new generation. History sidebar remains interactive throughout.

If implementing Option 2 (button approach): After successful generation, InputForm disappears and GeneratedItinerary shows with prominent 'New Itinerary' button. Clicking button triggers handleNewItinerary callback which sets appState to INPUT, hiding GeneratedItinerary and showing InputForm. Form fields behavior (cleared vs preserved) depends on question #2 answer. Button should have hover state, focus state for keyboard navigation, and disabled state during LOADING if user somehow triggers it.

Error handling: If generation fails, existing ErrorState with Retry button appears. Retry transitions back to InputForm with preserved data - this existing behavior is correct and should be maintained.

Loading states: Existing LoadingState with progress bar and status messages is correct. If question #8 answered to keep form visible during loading, form should show disabled state (grayed out inputs, disabled submit button).

Keyboard navigation: Ensure 'New Itinerary' button (if implemented) is keyboard accessible and in logical tab order. Form fields should maintain existing accessibility features.

Screen reader considerations: If Option 1 implemented, announce state change when itinerary appears alongside form. If Option 2, announce transition when 'New Itinerary' button is clicked. Existing form and itinerary components should already have proper ARIA labels.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

No authentication or authorization required. This is a public-facing POC with no user accounts. The fix does not introduce any protected operations or access control needs.

### Input Validation

No changes to input validation logic required. The existing InputForm component validates destination (minimum 3 characters), partyInfo (non-empty), travelMonth (selected from dropdown), and days (integer 1-7). These validation rules remain unchanged. The isFormValid function correctly enables/disables the GenerateButton. The fix only affects when the form is visible, not what validation rules apply. If implementing form pre-population from history selection (question #4), ensure pre-populated values are validated using existing validation logic to prevent edge cases where corrupted history data bypasses validation.

### Data Protection

No sensitive data protection considerations. All data (destination, party info, travel month, days, generated itinerary) is non-sensitive and stored in browser LocalStorage. No encryption or HTTPS requirements beyond existing POC setup. No new data exposure surfaces introduced by this fix.

<!-- SECTION:START:TESTING_STRATEGY -->

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Overview

Testing strategy must cover the new state transition and component visibility patterns introduced by this fix. Unit tests are required for the new business logic (handleNewItinerary callback if Option 2, or modified conditional rendering logic if Option 1). Component tests verify InputForm remains visible and interactive in the expected states. Integration tests validate the full user flow: submit form, view itinerary, trigger new itinerary action, submit again. E2E tests ensure the bug is fixed - user can generate multiple itineraries without page refresh.

Unit Tests:
- Test handleNewItinerary function transitions appState from SUCCESS to INPUT (Option 2)
- Test formData state preservation or clearing based on UX decision (question #2)
- Test conditional rendering logic includes InputForm in SUCCESS state (Option 1)
- Test handleSelectItinerary behavior with form pre-population if implemented (question #4)

Component Tests:
- Test InputForm renders correctly when appState is INPUT (existing)
- Test InputForm renders correctly when appState is SUCCESS (new, if Option 1)
- Test GeneratedItinerary includes 'New Itinerary' button (if Option 2)
- Test 'New Itinerary' button click triggers callback (if Option 2)
- Test form remains disabled during LOADING state
- Test form re-enables in SUCCESS state (if Option 1)

Integration Tests:
- Test user submits form, sees loading state, sees itinerary, sees form again (either simultaneously or via button)
- Test user generates second itinerary without page refresh
- Test history sidebar interaction while in different states
- Test form pre-population from history selection (if question #4 affirmative)
- Test error state Retry button still works with new visibility pattern

E2E Tests:
- Test critical user journey: load app, generate itinerary, generate second itinerary, verify both in history
- Test form visibility matches wireframe specification throughout journey
- Test mobile viewport behavior for form visibility and layout
- Test keyboard navigation through new flow (if button approach)

Testing frameworks: Use existing test setup (likely Vitest for unit/component, Playwright or Cypress for E2E). Leverage React Testing Library for component tests to ensure tests reflect actual user interactions.

### Critical Test Scenarios

1. Multi-Generation Happy Path: User loads app, fills form (destination: 'Tokyo', party: 'solo millennial', month: 'March', days: 3), clicks Generate, waits for loading, sees itinerary, triggers new itinerary action (button or directly via visible form), modifies form (change days to 5), clicks Generate again, waits for loading, sees second itinerary. Both itineraries appear in history sidebar. User should complete this flow without any page refresh.

2. Form Visibility After Generation: User generates an itinerary successfully, application transitions to SUCCESS state. InputForm component must be either (a) visible simultaneously with GeneratedItinerary if Option 1 selected, or (b) accessible via prominent 'New Itinerary' button if Option 2 selected. User should never be in a state where they cannot access the form without browser refresh.

3. History Interaction with Form: User generates itinerary A, clicks 'New Itinerary' (or form remains visible), clicks history item B from sidebar. History item B's itinerary displays in main content. If question #4 answered affirmatively, form fields auto-populate with itinerary B's parameters. User modifies one field and generates new itinerary C. All three itineraries exist in history.

4. Error Recovery Flow: User submits form, generation fails (timeout or API error), ErrorState appears with 'Retry' button. User clicks Retry, returns to InputForm with previous values preserved (existing behavior). User modifies one field, submits again, generation succeeds, itinerary appears. Form remains accessible for next generation.

5. Loading State Form Interaction: User submits form, LoadingState appears. If question #8 answered to keep form visible, form should be visible but all inputs disabled and submit button disabled with appropriate visual feedback. User cannot interact with form during generation. Once generation completes (success or error), form re-enables appropriately.

6. Rapid Multi-Generation: User generates three itineraries in rapid succession without selecting history items, each with different destinations. History sidebar should show all three items in chronological order (newest first). Each generation should successfully complete and display without interfering with previous generations.

7. Form State Preservation: User fills form partially (destination and party info only), navigates to history item, views itinerary, returns to form (via button or visible form). Partially filled fields should be either (a) preserved if question #2 answered to keep values, or (b) cleared if answered to reset. User should not lose work unexpectedly.

8. Mobile Viewport Transition: User on mobile device (viewport < 768px) generates itinerary. If Option 1 selected, form and itinerary should stack vertically with form collapsible or scrollable. If Option 2 selected, 'New Itinerary' button must be easily accessible without excessive scrolling. User taps button, form appears, user generates second itinerary.

9. Keyboard Navigation Flow: User navigates entire application using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape). After generating itinerary, user should be able to Tab to 'New Itinerary' button (if Option 2) or directly to form fields (if Option 1). Enter key on button or submit button should trigger expected actions. Focus management should be logical and predictable.

10. State Consistency After Multiple History Loads: User generates itinerary A, clicks history item B (older itinerary), clicks 'New Itinerary' button, form appears. User generates itinerary C. History sidebar should highlight itinerary C as newest. Clicking history item A should display itinerary A without clearing form fields (unless question #3 answered differently). Application state should remain consistent throughout multiple history navigations and new generations.
