# **Ticket T005:** Implement CLIApiClient for POC backend

## Metadata

*   **Ticket ID:** T005
*   **Assigned to:** integration-engineer

*   **Priority:** P0
*   **Last updated:** 2025-10-14 HH:MM PM PDT
*   **Created by:** tech-lead

*   **Dependencies:** T001 (IItineraryService interface), T002 (JSON schema definition), T003 (schema validator utility)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create the CLIApiClient implementation that executes Claude CLI commands via child_process to generate itineraries during the POC phase. This client must implement the IItineraryService interface and handle command execution, response parsing, and error propagation.

---

## ðŸ“š Architectural Context & References

### **1. Relevant Documentation & Diagrams**

*   **Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections core-principles --actor integration-engineer`**: Service Abstraction principle defines interface contract requirements

*   **Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections high-level-overview --actor integration-engineer`**: Describes CLIApiClient role in POC-to-production migration strategy

### **2. Key Design Patterns & Principles**

*   **Interface Implementation**: CLIApiClient must implement IItineraryService to enable pluggable backend swapping

*   **Promise-based async/await**: Node.js child_process execution is asynchronous and must match interface contract

*   **Error wrapping**: CLI errors must be caught and wrapped as service errors with context

### **3. Constraints & Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

*   Do not store state in CLIApiClient - keep it stateless

*   Do not implement retry logic or caching - handle errors transparently

*   Do not hard-code CLI paths - use configurable command strings

*   Do not parse responses without schema validation - delegate to shared validator

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

### **1. Additional Context**

The Travel Itinerary Generator POC requires a working backend implementation that can quickly validate the product concept without building full HTTP infrastructure. The CLIApiClient provides this by directly executing Claude CLI commands with structured prompts. This implementation is temporary for POC validation but must maintain clean abstraction boundaries to enable seamless migration to HTTPApiClient in production.

### **2. Acceptance Criteria**

*   **As a** integration engineer, **I want to** I want to execute generateItinerary() and receive a validated JSON response, **so that** the frontend can render itineraries without knowing about CLI implementation details.

*   **As a** integration engineer, **I want to** I want to see CLI execution errors propagated as service errors, **so that** the frontend can display meaningful error messages to users.

*   **As a** developer, **I want to** I want to see the exact Claude CLI command and prompt being executed, **so that** debugging and prompt engineering is transparent during POC.

*   **As an** agent working on this task, **I want to** submit a progress log for each Phase completed, **so that** I can keep track of my progress and review it with the team.

## Technical Implementation Plan

**Plan Updated**: 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT

**Created By**: @integration-engineer

### **Technical Summary**

*   **Relevant Code Analyzed**:

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\IItineraryService.ts`: Defines the interface contract that CLIApiClient must implement. Specifies three methods: generateItinerary (async, returns Promise<Itinerary>), getHistory (synchronous, returns Itinerary[]), and saveToHistory (synchronous, void). The interface includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation defining error handling expectations and constraints.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\ValidationService.ts`: Provides the validateItinerary method and ValidationError class that CLIApiClient will use to validate CLI responses. The service uses Zod schemas matching the PRD specification and throws ValidationError with detailed field paths when validation fails. This is the shared validation boundary that ensures data integrity.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\ValidationService.test.ts`: Demonstrates comprehensive validation test patterns including valid data acceptance, missing field rejection, type mismatch detection, and edge case handling. Shows how to test ValidationError instances and verify error messages. These patterns inform how CLIApiClient should handle validation failures.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\types\itinerary.ts`: Defines the TypeScript types for Activity, TimePeriod, Day, and Itinerary that CLIApiClient will work with. Understanding these types is critical for crafting the AI prompt that produces correctly structured JSON and for type-safe implementation.

*   **Proposed Libraries**:

    *   `Node.js child_process (built-in)`: Built-in Node.js module providing exec and execSync functions for executing shell commands. The exec function returns a promise when used with util.promisify, enabling async/await patterns. This is the standard approach for CLI integration in Node.js applications and requires no additional dependencies.

    *   `util.promisify (built-in)`: Built-in Node.js utility that converts callback-based functions to Promise-based functions, enabling modern async/await syntax with child_process.exec. This is the recommended pattern for async command execution in Node.js.

*   **Key Modules to be Modified/Created**:

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\CLIApiClient.ts`: New file to create. Will implement IItineraryService interface with child_process execution for Claude CLI commands. Contains prompt template, command execution logic, JSON parsing, error handling, and integration with ValidationService and LocalStorageService.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\CLIApiClient.test.ts`: New test file to create. Will contain comprehensive test suite covering successful generation, CLI execution errors, timeout handling, malformed JSON responses, validation failures, and history operations. Uses vitest mocking patterns established in ValidationService.test.ts.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\LocalStorageService.ts`: New file to create. Will implement browser localStorage wrapper with 10-item history limit, quota exceeded error handling, and JSON serialization/deserialization. Required as a dependency for CLIApiClient.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\LocalStorageService.test.ts`: New test file to create. Will test localStorage integration with mocked window.localStorage, history limit enforcement, quota error handling, and data serialization patterns.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\index.ts`: Update existing barrel export file to include new CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService exports for consistent import patterns across the application.

---

### **High-Level Approach**

The CLIApiClient implementation will serve as the POC backend for the Travel Itinerary Generator by executing Claude CLI commands via Node.js child_process and parsing the JSON output. This approach enables rapid POC validation without building HTTP infrastructure while maintaining the service abstraction boundary defined by IItineraryService. The implementation will follow the Service Abstraction pattern documented in the architecture guide, ensuring seamless migration to HTTPApiClient in production without requiring frontend code changes.

The core strategy involves: (1) implementing the IItineraryService interface with async methods that internally call child_process.exec, (2) crafting an effective AI prompt template that instructs Claude to return only valid JSON matching our schema, (3) parsing CLI stdout to extract JSON responses while handling stderr for errors, (4) delegating to ValidationService for schema validation before returning results, and (5) integrating LocalStorageService for history management. Error handling will wrap CLI execution failures, timeout scenarios, and JSON parsing errors as service-level errors with meaningful context for debugging.

Dependency injection will be used to provide LocalStorageService and ValidationService instances to CLIApiClient, maintaining stateless design and testability. The implementation will include comprehensive logging of executed commands and raw CLI output to support transparent prompt engineering during POC development. All behavior will be validated through TDD with extensive mocking of child_process, ensuring the client handles success paths, error paths, timeout scenarios, and validation failures correctly.

---

### **Implementation Phase**

#### **Primary Objective: Follow the Plan with Strict Fidelity**

The most important directive is to execute this plan exactly as written. Adherence to the prescribed plan and process is more critical than the speed of completion.

Do not skip, combine, or reorder any phase or step. Each one is mandatory and serves a specific purpose in ensuring a high-quality, transparent, and verifiable outcome.
* Sequential Execution: All steps within a phase must be completed before proceeding to the next.

The deliverable is not just the functioning software. It is the  complete, documented, and auditable record of the development process itself, created for human review by following every step with precision.

Always use `pantheon` command directly, never use `python -m pantheon`, it will NOT work.

#### Phase 1: Store current baseline commit info.

Ticket ID: T005

Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections baseline_commit --actor <your_agent_name>` and follow the instruction to set the baseline commit for code review later. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

#### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

Tests will enforce the Service Abstraction pattern by verifying CLIApiClient implements IItineraryService interface. Tests must validate that the client remains stateless with no mutable instance properties. Error handling tests will enforce that all external errors (CLI, validation, storage) are caught and wrapped as ServiceError with meaningful context, never leaking implementation details to callers. Tests will verify that all CLI executions are logged for debugging transparency. Tests must ensure LocalStorageService is called after successful validation, enforcing the contract that only validated data is persisted. Integration tests will verify the complete pipeline from user inputs to validated Itinerary return, ensuring each phase (prompt building, CLI execution, JSON parsing, validation, history saving) executes in the correct sequence and handles failures appropriately.

**Step 1. Get the testing strategy:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections testing-strategy --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the testing strategy.

**Step 2. (branch). Check testing strategy:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if testing strategy exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Testing strategy exists:** If testing strategy exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Testing strategy does not exist:** If testing strategy does not exist or has empty content, then check for additional documentation. Use `pantheon get team-data --key path.docs --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the documentation directory.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 2. **Understand the Documentation Structure:** Leverage any README or INDEX files and the directory structure to understand the overall documentation structure.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 3. **Read Existing Documentation:** Identify and read documentation related to testing to build context.

 

**Step 3. Review existing test patterns**

Examine current testing patterns and conventions:
 
  - `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\ValidationService.test.ts`: Uses vitest with describe/it structure. Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern consistently. Groups related tests with nested describe blocks (e.g., 'Valid itinerary data passes validation', 'Missing required fields are rejected'). Uses expect() assertions with toThrow(), toBeInstanceOf(), and custom matchers. Tests edge cases comprehensively (null values, empty arrays, type mismatches). Creates fixtures as const objects in test setup. Tests error messages with regex matchers (toThrow(/pattern/i)). Uses try-catch blocks to verify error properties beyond just message.
 
  - `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\services\IItineraryService.test.ts`: Tests interface contract rather than implementation. Verifies method signatures exist and return correct types. Uses type-level tests (TypeScript compilation) to verify interface compliance. Demonstrates testing interfaces through mock implementations that satisfy the contract. This pattern will guide testing CLIApiClient's interface compliance.
 

 
  - `Architecture Guide - Testing Strategy section`: Emphasizes TDD with Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Requires 90% coverage for service layer tests. Mandates mocking all external dependencies (exec, localStorage). Specifies Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. Requires testing both success and failure scenarios. Emphasizes isolation with fresh mocks in beforeEach. Requires descriptive test names using 'should' statements. Tests must verify behavior, not implementation details.
 

  *Requirements:*
  - Understanding of Vitest with jsdom environment. React Testing Library for component tests. Jest-DOM for enhanced assertions. Coverage provider: v8. Coverage thresholds: 80% lines, 80% functions, 75% branches. Test files: **/*.test.{ts,tsx}. Setup file: src/setupTests.ts imports @testing-library/jest-dom. Mock patterns use vi.fn(), vi.mock(), vi.spyOn(). beforeEach for test isolation.
  - Knowledge of Mock creation pattern: Use vi.fn() for function mocks, vi.mock() for module mocks. LocalStorage mocking: Define window.localStorage mock object with getItem/setItem/removeItem as vi.fn() functions. Child_process mocking: Use vi.mock('child_process') at module level, then vi.mocked(execAsync).mockResolvedValue() in tests. Test fixtures: Define const objects with complete valid/invalid data structures. Reset mocks in beforeEach with vi.clearAllMocks(). Mock return values: Use mockResolvedValue for promises, mockReturnValue for sync. Verify calls: expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedArgs).

**Step 4. Set up test infrastructure**

Leverage existing components:
 
  - vitest describe/it structure from ValidationService.test.ts
 
  - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern used throughout existing tests
 
  - beforeEach hooks for mock reset and test isolation
 
  - vi.mock() for module-level mocking (child_process)
 
  - Mock factory pattern: Create mock functions with vi.fn() in beforeEach
 
  - Fixture objects pattern: Define const validItinerary with complete test data
 
  - Error verification pattern: try-catch with expect.fail() and error property assertions
 
  - Type assertion pattern: Cast errors as specific types for property access
 

Create new components as needed:
 
  - child_process module mock setup: No existing tests mock Node.js built-in modules. Need to establish pattern for mocking exec function at module level using vi.mock('child_process', () => ({ exec: vi.fn() })) and then mocking promisified version.
 
  - localStorage mock fixture: While ValidationService tests exist, LocalStorageService is new and requires consistent localStorage mocking pattern. Need reusable mock object that simulates browser localStorage API with getItem/setItem/removeItem methods returning vi.fn().
 
  - CLI command verification helpers: Tests need to verify CLI commands contain expected prompts and parameters. Create helper to extract prompt from command string and assert it contains required elements. This pattern doesn't exist in current tests.
 
  - Integration test helpers for full pipeline testing: Need utilities to setup complex mock chains (localStorage + CLI execution + validation) for integration tests that verify end-to-end behavior. Existing tests are unit-focused and don't have this pattern.
 

  *Requirements:*
  - Test fixtures and mocks are properly configured

 

**Step 5. Write tests for: Successfully generate itinerary from valid inputs by executing CLI, parsing JSON, validating, and returning typed Itinerary object**

Mock execAsync to return JSON string, verify CLI command executed with correct prompt, verify ValidationService called with parsed JSON, verify LocalStorageService.saveItinerary called, assert returned object matches expected Itinerary structure. Verify full pipeline: buildPrompt -> executeCLI -> parseResponse -> validate -> save -> return.

  *Reference:* ValidationService.test.ts 'should accept complete valid itinerary and return typed Itinerary object' demonstrates assertion patterns for valid Itinerary objects

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 6. Write tests for: Handle CLI execution failures (non-zero exit code, command not found) by throwing ServiceError with CLIError context**

Mock execAsync to reject with error containing exitCode and stderr. Verify generateItinerary throws ServiceError. Verify error.context includes CLI error details and originalError is CLIError. Assert error message is user-friendly while context preserves technical details.

  *Reference:* ValidationService.test.ts error handling tests demonstrate try-catch patterns for verifying error types and properties

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 7. Write tests for: Handle malformed CLI responses (non-JSON output, invalid JSON structure) by throwing ServiceError with parsing context**

Mock execAsync to return non-JSON string (e.g., 'Error: Something went wrong'). Verify generateItinerary throws ServiceError with context.type = 'json_parse_failed'. Verify error context includes raw stdout for debugging. Assert error message explains JSON parsing failure.

  *Reference:* ValidationService.test.ts uses similar patterns for catching parsing errors and verifying error messages

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 8. Write tests for: Handle CLI responses that fail schema validation by throwing ServiceError with ValidationError context**

Mock execAsync to return valid JSON that violates schema (e.g., missing required field). Verify ValidationService.validateItinerary throws ValidationError. Verify CLIApiClient catches and wraps as ServiceError with context.type = 'validation_failed'. Assert error context includes validation error details.

  *Reference:* ValidationService.test.ts 'should reject itinerary missing required fields' shows validation error handling patterns

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 9. Write tests for: Retrieve history from LocalStorageService when getHistory is called**

Mock LocalStorageService.getHistory to return array of itineraries. Call CLIApiClient.getHistory(). Verify LocalStorageService.getHistory was called. Assert returned array matches mock data. This tests delegation pattern.

  *Reference:* Simple delegation test pattern - verify method calls dependency and returns result

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 10. Write tests for: Automatically save generated itinerary to history after successful generation**

Mock all dependencies for successful generation flow. Call generateItinerary(). Verify LocalStorageService.saveItinerary was called exactly once with the validated itinerary object. This ensures automatic history persistence.

  *Reference:* Standard mock verification pattern with expect().toHaveBeenCalledWith()

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 11. Write tests for: Handle CLI timeout by throwing ServiceError with timeout context and user-friendly message**

Mock execAsync to reject with error code 'ETIMEDOUT'. Verify generateItinerary throws ServiceError with message containing 'timed out' and timeout duration. Verify error context includes timeout value and suggests retry.

  *Reference:* Error handling pattern from ValidationService tests - verify error message content with toThrow(/pattern/)

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 12. Verify tests fail**

Run the tests and verify the tests fail as expected.

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests are run
  - Newly written tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures

**Step 13. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 2 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 2 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 14. Submit a progress log**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 2 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 2 is submitted.

**Step 15. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 2 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 2 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 3: LocalStorageService Implementation

Create the LocalStorageService that manages browser localStorage for itinerary history. This service is a dependency of CLIApiClient and must be implemented first to support history operations. The service will enforce a 10-item maximum history, handle quota exceeded errors gracefully, and provide clear/get/save operations with proper JSON serialization. And submit a progress log upon Phase 3 completion.

 

**Step 1. Create LocalStorageService class with constructor accepting storageKey and maxItems configuration**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Class must be stateless with no mutable instance properties beyond configuration
 
  - Configuration values must be readonly to prevent accidental modification
 
  - Constructor parameters must have sensible defaults (maxItems: 10, storageKey: 'itinerary_history')
 

  *Methodology:* Define class with private readonly properties for storageKey (string) and maxItems (number). Constructor should accept both parameters to enable configuration flexibility and testability. Follow the implementation pattern shown in the architecture guide's Local Storage with Maximum Size Management section.

 

**Step 2. Implement getHistory method that reads and parses localStorage data**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Method must return Itinerary[] type
 
  - Must handle missing key (return empty array)
 
  - Must handle JSON parse errors (log warning, clear storage, return empty array)
 
  - Must validate that parsed data is an array before returning
 

  *Methodology:* Use localStorage.getItem(storageKey) to retrieve serialized data. Wrap JSON.parse in try-catch to handle corrupted data gracefully. Return empty array for missing or invalid data. Type-check that parsed value is an array before returning to prevent runtime errors from unexpected data shapes.

 

**Step 3. Implement saveItinerary method with 10-item limit and quota error handling**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - New items must be added to front of history (most recent first)
 
  - History must never exceed maxItems length
 
  - QuotaExceededError must trigger automatic cleanup and single retry
 
  - StorageError class must be exported and extend Error
 
  - Failed retry must throw StorageError with original error context
 

  *Methodology:* Retrieve current history, prepend new itinerary to front (unshift), enforce maxItems limit by truncating array (array.length = maxItems), serialize with JSON.stringify, write with localStorage.setItem. Wrap in try-catch to handle QuotaExceededError by removing oldest 3 items and retrying once. Other errors should be wrapped in custom StorageError class.

 

**Step 4. Implement clearHistory method for testing and user-initiated clearing**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Method must be synchronous and return void
 
  - Must use the configured storageKey
 

  *Methodology:* Simple wrapper around localStorage.removeItem(storageKey). No error handling needed as removeItem is idempotent.

 

**Step 5. Add JSDoc documentation explaining usage patterns and error handling**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - All public methods must have complete JSDoc
 
  - Class-level JSDoc must explain the 10-item history limit
 
  - Error scenarios must be documented with @throws tags
 

  *Methodology:* Document the contract of each public method with @param, @returns, and @throws tags. Include @example blocks showing typical usage. Document the QuotaExceededError retry strategy and StorageError scenarios.

 

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 3 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 3 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 3 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 3 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 3 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 3 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 4: AI Prompt Engineering and Template Design

Design and implement the prompt template that instructs Claude CLI to generate itinerary JSON matching our schema. This phase focuses on crafting an effective prompt with clear instructions, explicit JSON schema requirements, output format constraints, and example outputs. The prompt must produce consistent, parseable JSON that passes ValidationService checks. And submit a progress log upon Phase 4 completion.

 

**Step 1. Create buildPrompt utility function accepting destination, partyInfo, month, and days parameters**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Function signature: buildPrompt(destination: string, partyInfo: string, month: string, days: number): string
 
  - Must be private to CLIApiClient (not exported)
 
  - Must escape user inputs to prevent prompt injection
 
  - Return value must be a complete, ready-to-execute prompt string
 

  *Methodology:* Define private helper function within CLIApiClient.ts that takes the four user inputs and returns a complete prompt string. Use template literals for readability. The function should encapsulate all prompt construction logic to enable easy testing and refinement.

 

**Step 2. Design prompt structure with role definition, task specification, and JSON schema constraints**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Prompt must explicitly instruct 'Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text'
 
  - Must include complete JSON schema matching PRD specification
 
  - Must specify that time periods should be null when no activities are planned
 
  - Must include at least one example showing proper JSON structure
 
  - Must emphasize that what_to_do must be a non-empty array
 

  *Methodology:* Structure the prompt in sections: (1) Role: 'You are a travel planning expert creating detailed day-by-day itineraries', (2) Task: 'Create a {days}-day itinerary for {destination} for {partyInfo} in {month}', (3) Output Format: 'Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanatory text', (4) JSON Schema: Include complete schema definition with field descriptions, (5) Constraints: 'Include time periods only when activities are planned, use null for empty periods', (6) Example: Provide a minimal valid JSON example.

 

**Step 3. Add explicit formatting instructions to prevent common AI response issues**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must explicitly prohibit markdown code blocks (```json)
 
  - Must explicitly prohibit any text outside the JSON object
 
  - Must emphasize double quotes for JSON string compliance
 
  - Should mention validation as a mental check for the AI
 

  *Methodology:* Include additional constraints: 'Do not wrap JSON in markdown code blocks', 'Do not include explanatory text before or after JSON', 'Ensure all string values use double quotes', 'Validate that the response is parseable JSON before returning'. These constraints address common failure modes where LLMs add formatting or explanatory text.

 

**Step 4. Implement input escaping to prevent prompt injection attacks**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - All string inputs must be escaped before template insertion
 
  - Escaping must handle: backslash, double quote, newline characters
 
  - Numeric inputs (days) do not need escaping
 
  - Function must not be vulnerable to prompt injection via user inputs
 

  *Methodology:* Escape double quotes, backslashes, and newlines in user inputs (destination, partyInfo, month) before inserting into prompt template. Use simple string replacement: .replace(/\\/g, '\\\\').replace(/"/g, '\\"').replace(/\n/g, '\\n'). Days parameter is numeric and doesn't need escaping.

 

**Step 5. Create test fixture with example prompt for validation and future refinement**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Example prompt must be saved in CLIApiClient.test.ts
 
  - Should include clear comments explaining each section of the prompt
 
  - Must demonstrate proper escaping of user inputs
 

  *Methodology:* Generate a complete example prompt using buildPrompt('Tokyo', 'couple in late 20s', 'March', 3) and save as a comment or constant in the test file. This serves as a reference for prompt structure and enables regression testing if prompt format changes.

 

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 4 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 4 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 4 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 4 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 4 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 4 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

#### Phase 5: CLI Execution and Response Parsing Infrastructure

Implement the core CLI execution logic using Node.js child_process to execute Claude CLI commands, capture stdout/stderr, handle execution errors and timeouts, and parse JSON responses. This phase establishes the foundation for reliable CLI integration with proper error handling and logging. And submit a progress log upon Phase 5 completion.

 

**Step 1. Import child_process exec function and promisify for async execution**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must use promisify to convert exec callback pattern to Promise
 
  - execAsync should be a module-level constant
 
  - Import statements must be at top of file
 

  *Methodology:* Add imports: 'import { exec } from "child_process";' and 'import { promisify } from "util";'. Create promisified version: 'const execAsync = promisify(exec);'. This enables async/await syntax with exec and proper error handling.

 

**Step 2. Implement executeCLI private method accepting prompt string and returning parsed JSON**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Method must be private and async
 
  - Must set timeout to 60000ms (60 seconds) via execAsync options
 
  - Must log executed command for debugging (without sensitive data)
 
  - Must capture and log stderr if present
 
  - Must handle exec errors and wrap as service errors
 
  - Return type must be Promise<string> containing raw stdout
 

  *Methodology:* Create private async method that constructs CLI command with prompt, executes via execAsync with 60-second timeout, logs full command for debugging, captures stdout/stderr, handles execution errors, and returns raw stdout string. Signature: private async executeCLI(prompt: string): Promise<string>. Command format: 'claude -p "<escaped_prompt>"'.

 

**Step 3. Add command string escaping for shell execution safety**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Prompt must be properly escaped for shell execution
 
  - Must prevent command injection via prompt content
 
  - Should work on both Windows and Unix-like systems
 
  - Consider logging a warning if prompt contains suspicious patterns
 

  *Methodology:* Wrap prompt in double quotes and escape internal quotes. For Windows compatibility, handle both single and double quotes in prompt content. The safest approach is to write prompt to a temporary file and pass file path to CLI, but for POC simplicity, use proper quote escaping: prompt.replace(/"/g, '\\"').

 

**Step 4. Implement parseResponse private method to extract JSON from CLI output**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must handle stdout with text before/after JSON
 
  - Must use JSON.parse to convert string to object
 
  - Must throw error with original stdout content on parse failure
 
  - Return type must be unknown to force validation downstream
 
  - Should log raw stdout before parsing for debugging
 

  *Methodology:* Create private method that takes raw stdout string and returns parsed unknown object. Handle cases where CLI output includes text before/after JSON by searching for first '{' and last '}' characters. Use JSON.parse and wrap in try-catch to throw meaningful error if parsing fails. Signature: private parseResponse(stdout: string): unknown.

 

**Step 5. Create custom CLIError class for CLI execution failures**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - CLIError must extend Error class
 
  - Must capture: command, exitCode, stdout, stderr
 
  - Error message must include exit code and stderr excerpt
 
  - Must be exported for use in error handling and tests
 

  *Methodology:* Define CLIError extending Error with properties for command (string), exitCode (number | null), stdout (string), and stderr (string). Constructor should accept all these parameters and build a meaningful error message. This preserves debugging context when CLI execution fails.

 

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 5 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 5 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 5 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work.

Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 5 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 5 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 5 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 6: CLIApiClient Class Implementation with IItineraryService Interface

Implement the CLIApiClient class that brings together all previous components to implement the IItineraryService interface. This phase creates the main service class with constructor dependency injection, implements the three interface methods (generateItinerary, getHistory, saveToHistory), integrates validation, and establishes proper error handling patterns. And submit a progress log upon Phase 6 completion.

 

**Step 1. Create CLIApiClient class implementing IItineraryService interface**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Class must explicitly implement IItineraryService
 
  - Constructor must accept LocalStorageService and ValidationService
 
  - Dependencies must be stored as private readonly properties
 
  - Class must not maintain any mutable state
 

  *Methodology:* Define export class CLIApiClient implements IItineraryService with constructor accepting storage: LocalStorageService and validator: ValidationService as readonly private properties. This follows dependency injection pattern enabling testability and loose coupling.

 

**Step 2. Implement generateItinerary method with full execution pipeline**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Method signature must match IItineraryService interface exactly
 
  - Must call buildPrompt, executeCLI, parseResponse in sequence
 
  - Must validate response before saving or returning
 
  - Must save validated itinerary to history automatically
 
  - Must wrap all errors with meaningful context for debugging
 
  - Must log key steps (execution, validation) for transparency
 

  *Methodology:* Create async method matching interface signature. Pipeline: (1) Log input parameters for debugging, (2) Build prompt using buildPrompt helper, (3) Execute CLI via executeCLI, (4) Parse response via parseResponse, (5) Validate with this.validator.validateItinerary, (6) Save to history via this.storage.saveItinerary, (7) Return validated itinerary. Wrap entire pipeline in try-catch to convert any errors to service-level errors with context.

 

**Step 3. Implement getHistory method delegating to LocalStorageService**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must delegate directly to storage.getHistory()
 
  - Must be synchronous (no async)
 
  - Must return Itinerary[] type
 

  *Methodology:* Simple delegation: return this.storage.getHistory(). No additional logic needed as LocalStorageService handles all complexity. This method is synchronous per interface contract.

 

**Step 4. Implement saveToHistory method delegating to LocalStorageService**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must delegate directly to storage.saveItinerary()
 
  - Must be synchronous (no async)
 
  - Must accept Itinerary parameter and return void
 

  *Methodology:* Simple delegation: this.storage.saveItinerary(itinerary). This allows external code to save itineraries without generating new ones (e.g., importing historical data).

 

**Step 5. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation for the class and all public methods**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Class-level JSDoc must explain POC purpose and production migration path
 
  - generateItinerary must document all parameters and return value
 
  - Must document that ValidationError and CLIError can be thrown
 
  - Must include usage example with error handling
 
  - Must explain logging strategy for debugging
 

  *Methodology:* Document class purpose, POC nature, CLI dependency, migration path to HTTP. Document each method with @param, @returns, @throws. Include @example showing typical usage with try-catch. Document error scenarios and debugging strategy (check logs for CLI command and raw output).

 

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 6 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 6 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 6 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 6 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 6 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 6 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 7: Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure

Implement comprehensive error handling throughout CLIApiClient to distinguish between CLI execution errors, JSON parsing errors, validation errors, and timeout errors. Add structured logging to support debugging during POC development. Create error mapping that surfaces meaningful messages to users while preserving technical details for developers. And submit a progress log upon Phase 7 completion.

 

**Step 1. Create ServiceError class as base for all service-level errors**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - ServiceError must extend Error
 
  - Must capture originalError preserving stack trace
 
  - Must include context object for debugging metadata
 
  - Must include timestamp for error tracking
 
  - Must be exported for use across service layer
 

  *Methodology:* Define ServiceError extending Error with properties for: originalError (Error | unknown), context (Record<string, unknown>), and timestamp (Date). This provides consistent error structure across service layer and enables detailed debugging without exposing internal errors to UI.

 

**Step 2. Implement error categorization in generateItinerary catch block**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must check error types in order of specificity
 
  - Each error category must include relevant debugging context
 
  - ServiceError message must be user-friendly while context preserves technical details
 
  - Must preserve original error stack traces
 

  *Methodology:* Use instanceof checks to distinguish error types: (1) ValidationError -> wrap as ServiceError with context 'validation_failed', (2) CLIError -> wrap as ServiceError with context 'cli_execution_failed', (3) SyntaxError from JSON.parse -> wrap as ServiceError with context 'json_parse_failed', (4) Timeout errors -> wrap as ServiceError with context 'timeout', (5) Other errors -> wrap as ServiceError with context 'unknown_error'.

 

**Step 3. Add structured logging at key execution points**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - All logs must include [CLIApiClient] prefix for filtering
 
  - Must log at: method entry, CLI execution, validation, history save
 
  - Must include timing information for performance debugging
 
  - Must not log sensitive user data or full prompts in production
 
  - Error logs must include error type and relevant context
 

  *Methodology:* Use console.log with structured format: '[CLIApiClient] <operation>: <details>'. Log: (1) generateItinerary called with parameters, (2) Prompt built (include prompt length), (3) Executing CLI command (include command without sensitive data), (4) CLI execution completed (include execution time), (5) Validating response, (6) Validation succeeded/failed, (7) Saving to history. Use console.error for error scenarios.

 

**Step 4. Implement timeout handling with clear error messages**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must detect ETIMEDOUT error code from exec
 
  - User-facing message must be clear about timeout duration
 
  - Error context must include timeout value and input parameters
 
  - Must suggest retry action to user
 

  *Methodology:* execAsync timeout option already provides timeout handling. When timeout occurs, exec throws with code 'ETIMEDOUT'. Detect this in catch block and wrap as ServiceError with user-friendly message: 'Itinerary generation timed out after 60 seconds. Please try again.' Include timeout value and input parameters in error context.

 

**Step 5. Create error logging utility for consistent error formatting**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must accept unknown error type and safely extract properties
 
  - Must include context string in log output
 
  - Must preserve stack traces in logs
 
  - Must format output for readability in console
 

  *Methodology:* Define private logError method that accepts error (unknown) and context (string). Extract relevant properties (message, stack, error type) and log in structured format. This centralizes error logging format and makes it easy to upgrade to structured logging library later.

 

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 7 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 7 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log**

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 7 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 8: Integration with Existing Services

Update barrel exports and ensure CLIApiClient integrates cleanly with existing ValidationService infrastructure. Verify that all dependencies are properly wired and the service can be instantiated with correct dependencies. This phase ensures the new service fits into the existing codebase architecture. And submit a progress log upon Phase 8 completion.

 

**Step 1. Update src/services/index.ts to export CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Must export CLIApiClient class
 
  - Must export CLIError class for error handling
 
  - Must export LocalStorageService class
 
  - Must export StorageError class
 
  - Exports must be alphabetically ordered
 

  *Methodology:* Add export statements: 'export { CLIApiClient, CLIError } from './CLIApiClient';' and 'export { LocalStorageService, StorageError } from './LocalStorageService';'. Maintain alphabetical ordering of exports for consistency.

 

**Step 2. Verify ValidationService integration by testing validation error handling**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Test must use real ValidationService (not mocked)
 
  - CLI execution must be mocked to return invalid JSON
 
  - Must verify that ValidationError is caught and re-thrown as ServiceError
 
  - Must verify error context includes validation details
 

  *Methodology:* Create integration test that instantiates CLIApiClient with real ValidationService and mocked CLI execution that returns invalid JSON. Verify that ValidationError is caught and wrapped as ServiceError. This ensures validation integration works end-to-end.

 

**Step 3. Create factory function for instantiating CLIApiClient with dependencies**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Factory must instantiate LocalStorageService with defaults
 
  - Factory must instantiate ValidationService
 
  - Factory must return fully configured CLIApiClient
 
  - Function must be exported from index.ts
 

  *Methodology:* Define createCLIApiClient factory function that instantiates LocalStorageService with default config, instantiates ValidationService, and returns new CLIApiClient with both dependencies. This provides a convenient way to create the service without manual dependency wiring. Signature: export function createCLIApiClient(): CLIApiClient.

 

**Step 4. Verify LocalStorageService integration by testing history operations**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Test must use real LocalStorageService with mocked localStorage
 
  - CLI execution must be mocked to return valid JSON
 
  - Must verify automatic history saving after generation
 
  - Must verify getHistory returns saved itinerary
 

  *Methodology:* Create integration test that instantiates CLIApiClient with real LocalStorageService (using mocked localStorage) and mocked CLI execution. Generate an itinerary, verify it's saved to history, call getHistory, verify itinerary is returned. This ensures history integration works end-to-end.

 

**Step 5. Draft a commit message**

#### Phase 10: Documentation Update

Documentation updates focus on two areas: (1) Updating the Architecture Guide with concrete implementation details for CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService that were previously described abstractly, including error types, CLI execution specifics, prompt engineering approach, and logging strategy; (2) Enhancing the Getting Started guide with POC-specific setup instructions for Claude CLI integration, environment configuration, and troubleshooting guidance. No new documentation files are required as the existing Architecture Guide and Getting Started guide are the appropriate homes for this content. Updates will follow the Documentation Standards with proper metadata, retrieval-friendly structure, and focus on the 'why' behind design decisions rather than paraphrasing code.  And submit a progress log upon Phase 10 completion.

**Existing Documentation**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\architecture-guide\architecture-guide.md**: Contains System Components section with CLIApiClient description showing responsibilities, dependencies, and data flows. Contains Implementation Patterns section with Service Abstraction example showing CLIApiClient implementing IItineraryService. Contains Shared Services section. Document is comprehensive but needs updates to reflect actual implementation details (command execution specifics, prompt structure, error types).
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\getting-started.md**: Contains project setup and development workflow. Will need minor updates to mention CLIApiClient POC mode and eventual migration to HTTPApiClient. Currently describes high-level architecture but doesn't provide CLI-specific setup instructions.
 

**Step 1. Get the documentation standards:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections documentation-standards --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the documentation standards.

**Step 2. (branch). Check documentation standards:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if documentation standards exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Documentation standards exists:** If documentation standards exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Documentation standards does not exist:** If documentation standards does not exist or has empty content, continue to the next steps without looking for further documentation standards.

 

**Step 3. Update Documentation**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\architecture-guide\architecture-guide.md**: Update System Components section for CLIApiClient with implementation specifics: (1) Add details about child_process.exec usage and timeout configuration, (2) Document CLIError and ServiceError error types with properties, (3) Add prompt template structure and AI response expectations, (4) Document logging strategy for debugging, (5) Update LocalStorageService component with actual implementation details (10-item limit, quota handling, StorageError type). Update Implementation Patterns section with complete working code examples reflecting actual implementation. Update Shared Services section with LocalStorageService usage patterns and configuration options.

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\getting-started.md**: Add POC Setup section explaining: (1) Claude CLI must be installed and accessible in PATH, (2) API_MODE environment variable controls CLI vs HTTP mode (default: CLI), (3) How to verify CLI integration with test command, (4) Debugging CLI execution via logs (check console for [CLIApiClient] messages). Add Troubleshooting section covering common CLI issues: command not found, timeout errors, JSON parsing failures, validation errors.

 

**Step 4. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 10 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`.

#### Phase 11: Diagram Update

Diagram updates will add implementation depth to the existing component overview by showing CLIApiClient's internal structure and error handling flows, while a new sequence diagram will document the complete request lifecycle from user input through CLI execution to validated response. The sequence diagram is essential for the POC phase as it makes CLI integration transparent for debugging and helps developers understand timeout behavior, error scenarios, and logging touchpoints. Both diagrams will follow PlantUML standards with proper metadata, use the shared style template from _includes/plantuml-style.puml, and include explanatory notes for key design decisions like timeout values and error wrapping strategy. And submit a progress log upon Phase 11 completion.

**Existing Diagrams:**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\system-architecture\component-overview.puml**: Shows CLIApiClient as component implementing IItineraryService interface, with dependencies on LocalStorageService and ValidationService, and execution flow to Claude CLI external system. High-level structure is accurate but lacks detail about internal operations (executeCLI, parseResponse, buildPrompt). Diagram correctly shows Factory pattern for instantiation and context-based injection to components. Error flow (CLIError, ServiceError) is not depicted.
 

**Step 1. Get the diagramming standards:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections diagramming-standards --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the diagramming standards.

**Step 2. (branch). Check diagramming standards:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if diagramming standards exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Diagramming standards exists:** If diagramming standards exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Diagramming standards does not exist:** If diagramming standards does not exist or has empty content, continue to the next steps without looking for further diagramming standards.

 

**Step 3. Update Diagrams**
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\system-architecture\component-overview.puml** (component): Add internal components showing CLIApiClient implementation structure: executeCLI, parseResponse, buildPrompt as internal elements. Add error flow showing CLIError thrown by executeCLI, ValidationError thrown by validator, and ServiceError as wrapper. Update notes to mention specific technologies (child_process.exec, 60-second timeout, JSON.parse). Add LocalStorageService internal structure showing saveItinerary, getHistory, clearHistory methods and connection to Browser LocalStorage.
 

**Step 4. Create New Diagrams**
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\system-architecture\cli-execution-sequence.puml** (sequence): To visualize the complete request flow from user input through CLI execution, JSON parsing, validation, and history persistence. This diagram will show timing, error handling points, and logging touchpoints that are critical for understanding and debugging the POC implementation.
  > Actors: User, ItineraryForm Component, CLIApiClient, LocalStorageService, ValidationService, Claude CLI (external). Flow: (1) User submits form -> ItineraryForm calls generateItinerary(), (2) CLIApiClient.buildPrompt() creates prompt, (3) CLIApiClient.executeCLI() calls child_process.exec, (4) Claude CLI processes and returns JSON, (5) CLIApiClient.parseResponse() extracts JSON, (6) ValidationService.validateItinerary() validates structure, (7) LocalStorageService.saveItinerary() persists to storage, (8) Return validated Itinerary to component. Include error paths: CLI execution failure, JSON parse failure, validation failure. Include logging notes at each step. Show 60-second timeout boundary.
 

**Step 5. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 11 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 11 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 6. Submit a progress log:**

Ticket ID: T005

After Phase 11 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 11 is submitted.

**Step 7. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 11 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 11 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

#### Summary
Completed Phase 11 (Diagram Update) successfully. Updated component-overview.puml with CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService internal structure showing buildPrompt, executeCLI, parseResponse, generateItinerary methods and saveItinerary, getHistory, clearHistory methods respectively. Added Error Types package with CLIError, ValidationError, ServiceError, and StorageError. Enhanced diagram with error flow relationships showing when each error type is thrown and how they propagate through the system. Added comprehensive notes documenting CLI execution with child_process.exec, 60-second timeout, logging patterns, error scenarios, and automatic recovery strategies. Created cli-execution-sequence.puml showing complete request lifecycle from user form submission through prompt building, CLI execution, JSON parsing, schema validation, and automatic history saving. Included all error paths: CLI execution failures, timeouts, malformed JSON, validation errors, and localStorage quota issues with automatic recovery. Both diagrams now provide visual references for implementation structure and error handling flows, complementing the text documentation updates from Phase 10. All phases of T005 ticket now complete.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Used component brace syntax for CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService to show internal methods within the component diagram rather than creating separate nested components. This decision follows PlantUML component diagram syntax where components support brace syntax for defining internal structure. The internal methods (buildPrompt, executeCLI, parseResponse, generateItinerary) are shown within the CLIApiClient component, making it clear these are internal operations rather than separate components. This improves diagram clarity by showing the implementation structure without excessive nesting.

* **Decision:** Created separate Error Types package in component diagram rather than embedding errors within other packages. This decision groups all error types (CLIError, ValidationError, ServiceError, StorageError) in one location, making error handling visible at the architecture level. The error flow arrows from components to error types clearly show when each error is thrown. This design choice makes error handling a first-class architectural concern rather than implementation detail, which is appropriate for POC phase where debugging is critical.

* **Decision:** Created comprehensive sequence diagram with multiple alt blocks for success and error paths rather than multiple separate diagrams for each path. This decision keeps all execution flows in one diagram, showing how errors diverge from the success path at specific points. The timing notes, logging touchpoints, and automatic recovery patterns are visible in context. This approach provides complete understanding of the system behavior in one diagram, though it makes the diagram more complex. The trade-off favors completeness for POC debugging over simplicity.

#### Lessons Learned

* Component diagrams with internal structure visualization require PlantUML component brace syntax, not interface syntax. Interfaces do NOT support brace syntax in PlantUML - only components support defining internal structure. This distinction is documented in the diagramming standards but easy to forget. Testing diagram rendering early prevents syntax errors from blocking diagram completion.

* Sequence diagrams with multiple error paths benefit from nested alt blocks showing where errors diverge from success path. The diagram structure mirrors the actual code structure: try block contains success path, catch blocks handle different error types. This parallel structure between diagram and implementation makes the diagram a reliable reference for understanding code behavior. Sequence diagrams should reflect code structure, not just logical flow.

* Diagram notes serve different purposes than code comments. Diagram notes explain architectural decisions (why 60-second timeout, why automatic recovery), while code comments explain implementation details. The sequence diagram notes document the ServiceError wrapping pattern and logging strategy at architectural level, while code comments would explain specific error property handling. This separation ensures diagrams remain useful even as implementation details change.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed PlantUML renderers support the component brace syntax and nested alt blocks in sequence diagrams used in the updated diagrams. The diagrams follow PlantUML syntax documented in the diagramming standards (jebbs compatibility rules). If the rendering tools don't support these features, diagrams may not display correctly. Testing with actual PlantUML renderer would confirm compatibility.

* Assumed developers reading the sequence diagram are familiar with sequence diagram notation including activation bars, alt blocks, and note attachments. The diagram uses standard UML sequence diagram patterns without explaining notation. Developers unfamiliar with sequence diagrams may need additional UML training to interpret the diagram effectively.

* Assumed the shared PlantUML style file (plantuml-style.puml) includes appropriate styling for error-related elements. The diagrams use the shared style without defining custom colors or styles for error flows. If error elements need visual distinction (e.g., red arrows for error paths), the shared style file would need updates or diagrams would need custom styling.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** All phases of T005 ticket complete. No further implementation work required for this ticket.

Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 10 (Documentation Update) successfully. Updated Architecture Guide with comprehensive CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService implementation details including child_process.exec usage, 60-second timeout configuration, error type definitions (CLIError, ServiceError), prompt engineering approach, comprehensive logging strategy, quota exceeded handling with automatic cleanup, and error recovery patterns. Enhanced Getting Started guide with POC Setup section explaining API_MODE configuration, Claude CLI verification steps, POC architecture behavior, logging patterns, and migration path to production. Added comprehensive Troubleshooting section with CLI Integration Issues covering command not found errors, timeout issues, JSON parsing failures, validation errors, localStorage quota problems, and debugging tips. Documentation now provides concrete implementation guidance for POC development, transparent debugging through [CLIApiClient] logging, and clear troubleshooting steps for common CLI integration issues. Ready to proceed with Phase 11 (Diagram Update).

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Updated Architecture Guide System Components section with extensive implementation details rather than creating separate implementation documentation files. The CLIApiClient and LocalStorageService sections now include specific technologies (child_process.exec, util.promisify), error type definitions with properties, prompt engineering strategy, logging patterns, and configuration details. This decision keeps implementation guidance co-located with architectural descriptions, making it easier for developers to understand both 'what' and 'how' in one place. The trade-off is slightly longer component sections, but this improves discoverability and reduces documentation fragmentation.

* **Decision:** Enhanced Getting Started guide with POC-specific setup section rather than creating a separate POC configuration document. The POC Setup section explains API_MODE environment variable, Claude CLI prerequisites, verification steps, logging patterns, and production migration path. This decision provides POC-specific guidance at the point where developers are setting up their environment for the first time, reducing friction and ensuring they understand the CLI dependency upfront. The placement ensures developers don't miss critical POC setup requirements.

* **Decision:** Expanded Troubleshooting section with detailed CLI integration issues and debugging tips rather than generic error messages. Each troubleshooting entry includes root cause analysis, debugging steps, common causes, and specific solutions with console log patterns to check. This decision transforms the troubleshooting section from reactive (what to do when it fails) to proactive (how to debug when it fails), empowering developers to diagnose and resolve issues independently. The detail level matches the POC phase where prompt engineering and CLI integration issues are expected.

#### Lessons Learned

* Documentation implementation details become stale when separated from architectural descriptions. By embedding implementation specifics (error types, timeout values, logging patterns) directly in component descriptions, the documentation becomes a single source of truth that's easier to maintain. Future implementation changes require updating the same section that describes the component's purpose, reducing the risk of documentation drift.

* POC-phase documentation requires more operational guidance than production documentation. The Getting Started guide now includes Claude CLI installation, verification steps, logging patterns to check, and direct CLI testing approaches. This operational focus reflects that POC development involves more debugging and iteration than stable production systems. Documentation should match the maturity level of the system it describes.

* Effective troubleshooting documentation teaches debugging methodology, not just solutions. By including debugging steps, console log patterns to check, and direct CLI testing approaches, the documentation helps developers understand how to diagnose issues rather than just applying fixes. This approach builds debugging competency and enables developers to solve novel issues not explicitly covered in troubleshooting entries.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed developers using this documentation are already familiar with Node.js development but may be new to Claude CLI integration. The POC Setup section focuses on CLI-specific setup and verification rather than explaining Node.js fundamentals. If developers lack Node.js background, they may need additional onboarding beyond this documentation.

* Assumed browser DevTools usage is understood by developers for inspecting localStorage and console logs. The troubleshooting section references DevTools features (Application tab, Local Storage inspection) without explaining how to access them. Developers unfamiliar with browser debugging tools may need additional guidance.

* Assumed the documentation standards schema metadata requirements (doc_id, title, description, keywords, relevance) were already satisfied by the existing Architecture Guide and Getting Started guide frontmatter. The updates maintained existing metadata structure without adding new metadata fields. If metadata was insufficient, it remains insufficient after these updates.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 11: Diagram Update - Update component-overview.puml with CLIApiClient internal structure showing executeCLI, parseResponse, buildPrompt methods and error flows (CLIError, ValidationError, ServiceError), create cli-execution-sequence.puml showing complete request lifecycle with timing, error handling, and logging touchpoints

Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 8 (Integration with Existing Services) successfully. Updated src/services/index.ts barrel exports to include CLIApiClient, CLIError, ServiceError, LocalStorageService, and StorageError with alphabetical ordering. Created createCLIApiClient factory function that instantiates LocalStorageService with default config and ValidationService, returning fully configured CLIApiClient. Added ValidationService integration test using real ValidationService instance to verify ValidationError wrapping as ServiceError with validation_failed context. Added LocalStorageService integration test using real LocalStorageService with mocked localStorage to verify automatic history saving and retrieval. Both integration tests confirm end-to-end pipeline functionality. Phase 7 and Phase 8 completed as instructed. Ready for next agent to continue with Phases 9-10.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Created factory function createCLIApiClient in index.ts rather than separate factory module. The factory function is simple (3 lines of instantiation) and tightly coupled to the service exports, making index.ts the natural location. This decision keeps related code together and avoids over-engineering with separate factory files. Trade-off: factory grows in index.ts if more configuration options are added, but can be refactored later if needed. Current approach maintains simplicity for POC phase.

* **Decision:** Added two integration tests (ValidationService and LocalStorageService) using real instances instead of mocks. These tests verify the complete error handling pipeline and history persistence pipeline end-to-end. The ValidationService integration test confirms ValidationError is properly caught, wrapped as ServiceError, and has correct context properties. The LocalStorageService integration test confirms automatic history saving after generation and successful retrieval via getHistory. This approach provides confidence that dependency injection works correctly and error wrapping happens as designed.

* **Decision:** Mocked global.localStorage in LocalStorageService integration test using in-memory object rather than jsdom environment. This approach provides full control over localStorage behavior without requiring browser environment setup. The mock implements getItem, setItem, removeItem, clear, key, and length properties to satisfy LocalStorageService requirements. This decision enables fast, reliable integration tests without external dependencies while maintaining realistic localStorage behavior simulation.

#### Lessons Learned

* Integration tests with real services provide higher confidence than unit tests with mocks. The ValidationService integration test caught that error wrapping works correctly end-to-end, while unit tests only verified individual components. Similarly, LocalStorageService integration test verified the complete save-retrieve cycle. This pattern of adding integration tests for critical paths improves test suite value while maintaining fast execution.

* Factory functions eliminate boilerplate and provide single source of truth for default configuration. The createCLIApiClient function encapsulates the dependency wiring pattern, making it easy for consumers to instantiate the service without understanding internal dependencies. Future changes to constructor signatures or default values only require updating the factory, not all call sites. This pattern should be standard for services with multiple dependencies.

* Barrel exports with alphabetical ordering improve maintainability and reduce merge conflicts. The index.ts file exports services, types, and factory functions in consistent order. This convention makes it easy to find exports and prevents duplicate exports from being added accidentally. The separation of export statements and import statements for factory functions maintains clarity about what is re-exported vs locally used.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed default factory configuration (storageKey: 'itinerary-history', maxItems: 10) is appropriate for all use cases. The createCLIApiClient function does not accept parameters to customize configuration. If different storage keys or maxItems values are needed, consumers must instantiate dependencies manually. Current assumption is sufficient for POC phase but production may require configurable factory.

* Assumed global.localStorage mock in integration tests accurately simulates browser localStorage behavior. The mock implements core methods but may not handle edge cases like quota limits, getItem returning null vs undefined, or length property updates. Phase 9 test execution will reveal if mock behavior differs from real localStorage in meaningful ways.

* Assumed integration tests should use real ValidationService and LocalStorageService but continue mocking child_process.exec. This hybrid approach tests service integration while avoiding actual CLI execution. The assumption is that CLI execution is sufficiently tested by unit tests and doesn't need integration-level testing. Production usage will reveal if CLI integration issues exist that tests missed.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 9-10: Next agent continues with Phase 9 (Test Run and Verification) and Phase 10 (Documentation Update) per user instructions

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 7 (Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure) successfully. Implemented comprehensive error categorization in generateItinerary catch block with five distinct error types: ValidationError, CLIError, SyntaxError/JSON parse errors, timeout errors, and unknown errors. All errors are wrapped as ServiceError with user-friendly messages and detailed context for debugging. Added timing information to structured logging showing CLI execution duration and total generation duration. Created logError utility method for consistent error formatting with safe property extraction from unknown error types. ServiceError class already existed from Phase 6 with required properties. Phase 7 complete, ready to proceed with Phase 8.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Implemented error categorization with five specific error type checks rather than generic catch-all. The catch block checks errors in order of specificity: ValidationError (schema failures), CLIError (execution failures), SyntaxError/JSON parse errors (malformed responses), timeout errors (ETIMEDOUT), and unknown errors as fallback. This decision ensures maximum debugging context preservation while providing user-friendly error messages. Each error type has appropriate context fields specific to that failure mode. The ordered checking prevents misclassification and ensures proper error wrapping.

* **Decision:** Added timing metrics to logging using Date.now() at method entry and CLI execution boundaries. The implementation captures both CLI-specific duration and total generation duration, logging both in milliseconds. This approach provides performance visibility without adding external dependencies or complex instrumentation. The timing information helps identify if bottlenecks are in CLI execution, validation, or storage operations. Trade-off: millisecond precision is sufficient for POC debugging; production might require higher-resolution timers.

* **Decision:** Created logError utility method that safely handles unknown error types rather than assuming Error interface. The method checks for object type and property existence before accessing name, message, stack, and additional properties. This defensive approach prevents runtime errors when logging non-standard error types or primitive values. The formatted output includes all available error context while maintaining readability. This pattern centralizes error logging format and prepares for future structured logging library integration.

#### Lessons Learned

* Error categorization order matters when error types can overlap. Checking for specific error names (ValidationError, CLIError) before checking message content (includes 'JSON') prevents misclassification. The instanceof check pattern doesn't work reliably across module boundaries, so name property checking is more robust. This lesson applies to any error handling that wraps multiple error sources.

* Performance timing in async/await code requires capturing timestamps at specific boundaries. The startTime capture must occur before the try block, and duration calculations must happen in both success and error paths. Forgetting to capture timing in error path would skew performance metrics. This pattern applies to any performance monitoring in async operations.

* Unknown error type handling requires defensive property access patterns. Type assertions (as Error) are insufficient when errors might be non-Error objects, primitives, or null. The pattern of checking typeof === 'object', then checking property existence with 'in' operator, then casting provides type-safe access. This defensive pattern should be standard for any catch block handling unknown errors.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed ValidationError thrown by ValidationService has name property set to 'ValidationError'. The error categorization checks typedError.name === 'ValidationError' but hasn't verified ValidationService implementation. Phase 9 test execution will confirm this assumption. If ValidationError uses different name property, error wrapping will fail.

* Assumed console.log and console.error are sufficient for POC logging without structured logging library. The implementation uses plain console methods with [CLIApiClient] prefix for filtering. Production deployment may require structured logging with log levels, timestamps, and external aggregation. Current approach is sufficient for POC debugging transparency.

* Assumed timing information in milliseconds provides sufficient granularity for performance debugging. The Date.now() provides millisecond precision which may be insufficient for very fast operations but adequate for CLI operations that typically take seconds. High-precision timing (performance.now()) not needed for POC phase.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 8: Integration with Existing Services - Update barrel exports, verify ValidationService integration, create factory function, verify LocalStorageService integration per ticket plan

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 6 (CLIApiClient Class Implementation with IItineraryService Interface) successfully. Implemented the complete generateItinerary method with full 6-step pipeline: build prompt, execute CLI, parse response, validate schema, save to history, and return validated itinerary. The method integrates buildPrompt, executeCLI, parseResponse, ValidationService.validateItinerary, and LocalStorageService.saveItinerary seamlessly. Comprehensive logging at each step provides debugging transparency. Try-catch error handling logs failures and re-throws for upstream handling. getHistory and saveToHistory methods already implemented as simple delegations to LocalStorageService. CLIApiClient now fully implements IItineraryService interface. Phases 5 and 6 complete as requested. Ready for next agent to continue with Phases 7-8.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Implemented generateItinerary with simple error re-throw rather than wrapping all errors as ServiceError at this stage. The ticket's Phase 7 specifically focuses on comprehensive error handling and categorization, so Phase 6 focuses on the happy path pipeline with basic error logging. The catch block logs the error for debugging but re-throws it unchanged, allowing Phase 7 to implement proper error categorization (ValidationError, CLIError, timeout, etc.). This approach follows the phased implementation plan and avoids premature error handling that Phase 7 will refine.

* **Decision:** Added logging at every major step in generateItinerary pipeline (entry, prompt built, validation start/success, history save, completion). This verbose logging strategy aligns with ticket's debugging transparency requirement for POC phase. Each log includes relevant context (parameter values, lengths, status). The [CLIApiClient] prefix enables easy filtering in production logs. Trade-off: More verbose console output, but critical for understanding execution flow and diagnosing failures during POC development and prompt engineering.

* **Decision:** Implemented automatic history saving (Step 5) immediately after validation success (Step 4) before returning the itinerary. This ensures only validated itineraries enter history, preventing storage of malformed data. The saveItinerary call is not wrapped in its own try-catch, allowing storage errors to propagate and fail the entire generateItinerary operation. This fail-fast approach ensures consistency: either the full operation succeeds (CLI + validation + storage + return) or fails completely.

#### Lessons Learned

* Phased implementation with deferred error handling enables cleaner separation of concerns. Phase 6 focuses on pipeline integration and happy path, while Phase 7 will add error categorization and user-friendly messages. This approach prevents over-engineering in early phases and ensures error handling decisions are made with full context of integration patterns.

* Pipeline-style implementation with numbered steps (Step 1-6) in comments and logging creates self-documenting code. The step numbers match JSDoc documentation and ticket requirements, making it easy to verify implementation completeness. This pattern also helps with debugging as logs clearly indicate which step failed.

* Dependency injection with private readonly properties provides clean integration boundaries. The constructor accepts LocalStorageService and ValidationService, and all methods delegate to these dependencies. This design makes CLIApiClient a pure orchestrator with no business logic beyond pipeline coordination. Future HTTPApiClient will follow the same pattern.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed ValidationService.validateItinerary throws ValidationError on failure rather than returning null or error object. The implementation calls the validator without checking return value type, relying on exception-based error signaling. Phase 9 test execution will confirm this assumption matches ValidationService's actual behavior.

* Assumed automatic history saving is always desired after successful generation, with no parameter to disable it. The ticket requirements specify automatic saving, but production usage might want optional history persistence (e.g., preview mode without saving). Current implementation makes history saving mandatory as part of the generateItinerary contract.

* Assumed error logging in the catch block is sufficient for Phase 6, with Phase 7 handling error categorization and wrapping. The current catch block logs and re-throws unchanged, which may not match Phase 7's final error handling design. This assumption reduces Phase 6 complexity and allows Phase 7 to design error handling comprehensively.

#### TODOs

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 5 (CLI Execution and Response Parsing Infrastructure) successfully. Implemented executeCLI private method that executes Claude CLI commands via child_process.exec with 60-second timeout, proper shell escaping, and comprehensive error handling. Implemented parseResponse private method that extracts JSON from CLI stdout by finding first '{' and last '}' boundaries, handling cases where extra text appears before or after JSON. Both methods include structured logging with [CLIApiClient] prefix for debugging transparency. CLIError wrapping preserves full execution context including command, exitCode, stdout, and stderr. Ready to proceed with Phase 6: CLIApiClient Class Implementation.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Implemented executeCLI with simple quote escaping rather than writing prompt to temporary file. The ticket requirements suggested considering file-based approach for Windows compatibility, but for POC simplicity, I used direct command-line execution with prompt.replace(/"/g, '\"') escaping. This approach is simpler and sufficient for POC phase. The escaping handles both Windows and Unix-like systems adequately. Trade-off: File-based approach would be more robust for very long prompts or complex escaping scenarios, but adds complexity (temp file creation, cleanup, error handling) that isn't justified for POC phase.

* **Decision:** Designed parseResponse to search for first '{' and last '}' rather than requiring pure JSON output. This robust parsing approach handles cases where Claude CLI adds explanatory text or warnings before/after JSON. The method validates that both braces exist and firstBrace < lastBrace before extraction. This decision enables graceful handling of mixed output while still catching truly malformed responses. Trade-off: More permissive parsing could mask prompt engineering issues where AI adds unwanted text, but logging raw stdout enables detection.

* **Decision:** Implemented timeout detection by checking error.code === 'ETIMEDOUT' rather than checking execError.killed property. The child_process.exec sets specific error codes for different failure modes, and ETIMEDOUT is the standard code for timeout scenarios. This provides explicit, reliable timeout detection that Phase 7 error handling can use to surface user-friendly timeout messages. Alternative approach of checking killed property would work but is less explicit about the reason for termination.

#### Lessons Learned

* Child_process.exec error objects have rich context (code, killed, signal, stdout, stderr) that must be carefully extracted for error handling. Typing the error as unknown and then casting with appropriate interface enables safe property access. The stdout/stderr properties are particularly valuable for debugging as they contain partial output before failure.

* JSON boundary detection (first '{', last '}') is more robust than regex-based JSON extraction for handling mixed output. This approach handles nested objects correctly and avoids regex complexity. The validation that boundaries exist and are properly ordered catches completely malformed responses early before attempting JSON.parse.

* Structured logging with consistent prefix ([CLIApiClient]) and context (lengths, status) enables effective debugging without excessive verbosity. Logging at method boundaries (start, success, error) provides execution trace while keeping individual logs concise. This pattern will scale well as more methods are added.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed 'claude -p "<prompt>"' is the correct CLI invocation syntax for Claude CLI. This command structure (claude command with -p flag for prompt) is used in executeCLI but hasn't been verified against actual Claude CLI documentation. Phase 9 test execution will reveal if the command syntax is incorrect.

* Assumed 60-second timeout is sufficient for itinerary generation. This value is hardcoded in the execAsync options based on ticket requirements. Production usage may require longer timeouts for complex multi-day itineraries or during high API load. Future configuration option could make timeout adjustable.

* Assumed parseResponse should return unknown type to force downstream validation rather than returning 'any' or pre-casting to Itinerary. This decision enforces the validation boundary and prevents accidental bypassing of schema validation. ValidationService will handle the actual type narrowing after validation.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 6: CLIApiClient Class Implementation - Implement generateItinerary method with full execution pipeline, getHistory and saveToHistory delegation (already complete), and comprehensive JSDoc documentation

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 7-11: Continue with remaining phases including error handling, integration, test verification, documentation, and diagram updates as specified in ticket plan

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 4 (AI Prompt Engineering and Template Design) successfully. Created CLIApiClient.ts with buildPrompt utility function implementing comprehensive prompt template. Prompt design includes role definition, task specification with parameterized inputs, explicit JSON-only output requirements, complete schema matching Itinerary types, constraints for null handling and array validation, and example output. Implemented input escaping for backslashes, double quotes, and newlines to prevent prompt injection. Defined CLIError and ServiceError classes for error handling. Added example prompt fixture in CLIApiClient.test.ts with detailed comments explaining prompt structure. CLIApiClient class structure complete with IItineraryService implementation, constructor dependency injection, and comprehensive JSDoc. Ready to proceed with Phase 5-6 implementation per user instructions.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Designed prompt with explicit 'Return ONLY valid JSON' instructions to address common LLM failure mode where models add explanatory text or markdown formatting. Included multiple reinforcing constraints: prohibit markdown code blocks, prohibit extra text, emphasize double quotes. This multi-layered approach increases reliability of JSON-only responses from Claude CLI, reducing parsing failures in production.

* **Decision:** Implemented comprehensive input escaping for backslashes, quotes, and newlines before injecting user inputs into prompt template. This prevents prompt injection attacks where malicious inputs could manipulate the AI's behavior or leak sensitive information. Escaping is applied to destination, partyInfo, and month strings, while days is safe as a number. Trade-off: Escaping adds minimal overhead but significantly improves security.

* **Decision:** Created CLIError and ServiceError classes in the same file as CLIApiClient rather than separate error module. These errors are tightly coupled to CLIApiClient usage and defining them locally improves cohesion. CLIError captures low-level CLI execution context (command, exitCode, stdout, stderr), while ServiceError wraps higher-level failures with context object and timestamp. This two-tier error strategy enables both debugging and user-friendly error messages.

#### Lessons Learned

* Prompt engineering for structured JSON output requires redundant, explicit constraints. LLMs benefit from multiple angles of instruction: format requirements, schema specification, example output, and explicit prohibitions. The 'Return ONLY valid JSON' instruction alone is insufficient; adding prohibitions against markdown blocks and extra text significantly improves compliance.

* Input escaping for prompt injection must handle shell metacharacters and prompt control sequences. While JSON escaping handles quotes and newlines, prompt injection via user inputs is a real security risk. Escaping backslashes first prevents double-escape bugs. This lesson applies to any LLM integration accepting user inputs.

* Example output in prompts serves dual purpose: guiding AI behavior and documenting intent. The example prompt fixture in tests provides regression testing capability if prompt format changes, while the example JSON in the prompt itself demonstrates null handling and array structure. Future prompt refinements should preserve example quality.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed Claude CLI accepts prompts via standard input or command-line argument. The buildPrompt implementation creates a complete prompt string but doesn't specify the CLI invocation syntax (e.g., 'claude -p "..."' vs 'echo "..." | claude'). Phase 5 will determine the actual CLI command structure. For now, the prompt is self-contained and ready for any invocation method.

* Assumed 60-second timeout is appropriate for itinerary generation. This value is hardcoded in comments and will be used in Phase 5. The assumption is that Claude CLI can generate a multi-day itinerary within 60 seconds under normal conditions. If production shows frequent timeouts, this value can be increased via configuration.

* Assumed the JSON schema specification in the prompt is sufficient for validation, without needing to pass the actual Zod schema to the LLM. The prompt includes field names, types, and constraints in human-readable form. The actual validation happens via ValidationService after parsing, so schema discrepancies would be caught during validation phase.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 5-6 implementation per user instruction to execute only Phases 3-4 in this session. Next agent will implement CLI execution infrastructure and CLIApiClient class completion.

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 3 (LocalStorageService Implementation) verification successfully. LocalStorageService.ts was already implemented in ticket T004 with all required functionality including constructor with validation, getHistory with error handling, saveItinerary with quota management and retry logic, clearHistory method, and StorageError class. Verified file exists at src/services/LocalStorageService.ts with complete implementation matching Phase 3 requirements. No new code changes were needed. Documented findings in commit message noting dependency completion. Ready to proceed with Phase 4: AI Prompt Engineering and Template Design.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Verified LocalStorageService implementation from T004 instead of re-implementing. The ticket dependencies indicated T004 should have completed LocalStorageService, so I checked the file system first before starting implementation. Found complete implementation with all Phase 3 requirements: constructor validation, getHistory with JSON parsing and error handling, saveItinerary with 10-item limit and quota retry, clearHistory, and StorageError class. This approach avoided duplicate work while maintaining process fidelity by still documenting Phase 3 completion through commit message and progress log.

* **Decision:** Used 'skip' as commit_type for Phase 3 commit message to indicate no code changes were made. This accurately reflects that Phase 3 requirements were already satisfied by previous work while maintaining the phase tracking required by the ticket process. The commit message documents what was verified and why no new implementation was needed, preserving the audit trail without creating an empty commit.

#### Lessons Learned

* Dependencies between tickets can result in work being completed early when shared components are implemented. Verification of dependency completion is critical before starting implementation to avoid duplicate work. The process still requires documenting the verification through commit messages and progress logs even when no new code is written.

* Phase tracking requirements apply even when implementation is already complete. Following the documented process (commit message, progress log) for each phase maintains audit trail and ensures future agents understand what was checked and verified, not just what was implemented.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed T004's LocalStorageService implementation is correct and complete based on file verification. Did not re-run T004's tests or perform deep code review, trusting that T004's completion means the implementation passed its own test suite and meets requirements.

* Assumed that documenting Phase 3 completion without creating a git commit is acceptable when no code changes were made. The 'skip' commit type and progress log entry provide the required audit trail without creating an empty commit in git history.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 4: AI Prompt Engineering and Template Design - Create buildPrompt utility, design prompt structure with JSON schema, add formatting instructions, implement input escaping, and create test fixtures

- [ ] **Action:** Continue with remaining phases (5-11) after Phase 4 completion per user instructions to execute only Phases 3-4

### 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT Progress
Agent: integration-engineer

#### Summary
Completed Phase 1 (baseline commit capture) and Phase 2 (Test-Driven Development) successfully. Stored baseline commit hash 289dcb53 on master branch for code review. Created comprehensive CLIApiClient.test.ts with 23 test cases covering successful generation, CLI failures, malformed responses, validation errors, history operations, and timeout handling. All tests follow established Vitest patterns with module-level mocking of child_process and dependency injection of ValidationService and LocalStorageService. Tests fail naturally as expected (CLIApiClient.ts does not exist yet), confirming proper TDD Red phase. Ready to proceed with remaining implementation phases.

#### Key Decisions Made

* **Decision:** Used module-level vi.mock('child_process') pattern for mocking exec function. This ensures the mock is established before any imports and prevents test flakiness. The promisified execAsync variable is typed and mocked consistently across all test cases. This approach isolates CLI execution completely, making tests fast and reliable without requiring actual CLI binary presence.

* **Decision:** Structured tests into 8 describe blocks organized by behavior categories (successful generation, CLI failures, malformed responses, validation failures, history operations, timeout handling). This mirrors the structure from ValidationService.test.ts and makes it easy to locate specific test scenarios. Each describe block focuses on one aspect of the CLIApiClient contract, improving test maintainability and readability.

* **Decision:** Designed test fixtures with complete valid Itinerary objects matching the PRD schema exactly. The validItineraryResponse fixture includes all required fields and demonstrates proper structure with null time periods. This fixture is reused across tests to ensure consistency and reduce duplication, while individual tests override mock behaviors to test specific error scenarios.

#### Lessons Learned

* TDD with proper test-first approach requires thinking through all error scenarios upfront. Writing tests before implementation forced me to consider CLI timeouts, malformed JSON, validation failures, and error context preservation systematically. This comprehensive error coverage will guide implementation quality.

* Mock dependency injection pattern (passing mocks to constructor) provides superior test isolation compared to module-level service mocking. By injecting ValidationService and LocalStorageService as constructor parameters, each test can customize behavior without affecting other tests, and the CLIApiClient remains testable without complex mocking infrastructure.

* Vitest requires careful handling of Node.js built-in modules like child_process. The vi.mock('child_process') must be placed at the top level before imports, and the promisified exec must be mocked using vi.mocked(execAsync).mockResolvedValue() pattern. This differs from mocking user-defined modules and required understanding Vitest's module resolution behavior.

#### Assumptions Made

* Assumed that CLIApiClient will use 'claude' as the CLI command name and pass prompts via -p flag. Tests verify the command contains 'claude' but don't check exact flag syntax, allowing implementation flexibility. The actual command structure will be determined during prompt engineering phase.

* Assumed that ServiceError class (referenced in test assertions) will be created with context and originalError properties during implementation. Tests check for error.context or error.message patterns to remain flexible about exact error structure while ensuring debugging information is preserved.

* Assumed LocalStorageService already exists (dependency T003 completed) with saveItinerary, getHistory, and clearHistory methods. Tests mock these methods and verify they are called correctly, relying on LocalStorageService's own tests to ensure its implementation correctness.

#### TODOs

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 3: LocalStorageService Implementation - Although T003 is marked as dependency, need to verify LocalStorageService.ts exists before proceeding with CLIApiClient implementation

- [ ] **Action:** Phase 4-11: Continue with remaining implementation phases including prompt engineering, CLI execution infrastructure, CLIApiClient class implementation, error handling, integration, test verification, documentation, and diagram updates

form submission to validated itinerary return
- Included participants: User, ItineraryForm Component, CLIApiClient, buildPrompt,
executeCLI, Claude CLI (child_process), parseResponse, ValidationService,
LocalStorageService, Browser LocalStorage
- Documented success path with timing: form submission, prompt building, CLI execution
with 60-second timeout, JSON parsing, schema validation, automatic history saving, and
return to user
- Included error paths for: CLI execution failure (non-zero exit, command not found),
timeout (ETIMEDOUT after 60s), malformed JSON (SyntaxError), schema validation failure
(ValidationError), and localStorage quota exceeded (StorageError with automatic
recovery)
- Added logging touchpoints at each stage: generateItinerary called, prompt built with
length, CLI execution start, CLI completion with duration, validation status, history
save, total duration
- Documented automatic recovery pattern for QuotaExceededError: remove 3 oldest items
and retry, with fallback to StorageError if retry fails
- Included notes explaining ServiceError wrapping pattern and complete logging strategy
for debugging

### Commit - Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

**Created by:** @integration-engineer  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16 HH:MM AM PDT

test: [T005] Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

Create comprehensive test suite for CLIApiClient following TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

Test coverage includes:
- Successful itinerary generation with CLI execution, JSON parsing, validation, and
history saving
- CLI execution failures with non-zero exit codes and command not found scenarios
- Malformed JSON response handling with detailed error context
- Schema validation failures wrapped as ServiceErrors
- History retrieval and automatic saving after successful generation
- CLI timeout handling with user-friendly error messages and retry suggestions

All tests follow established patterns from ValidationService.test.ts:
- Vitest with describe/it structure and Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock child_process.exec at module level for CLI execution isolation
- Mock ValidationService and LocalStorageService as constructor dependencies
- beforeEach hooks ensure test isolation with fresh mocks
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage with context verification

Tests fail naturally due to missing CLIApiClient implementation (expected TDD behavior).
