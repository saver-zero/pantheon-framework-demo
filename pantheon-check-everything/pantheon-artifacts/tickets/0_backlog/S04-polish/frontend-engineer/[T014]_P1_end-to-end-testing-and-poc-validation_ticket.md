# **Ticket T014:** End-to-end testing and POC validation

## Metadata

*   **Ticket ID:** T014
*   **Assigned to:** frontend-engineer

*   **Priority:** P1
*   **Last updated:** 2025-10-14 HH:MM PM PDT
*   **Created by:** tech-lead

*   **Dependencies:** All previous tickets (T001-T013) must be complete before final testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete Travel Itinerary Generator POC across browsers, devices, and scenarios to validate product concept and identify any remaining issues before user testing. Document test results, verify all acceptance criteria, and confirm the system is ready for stakeholder demo and real user validation.

---

## ðŸ“š Architectural Context & References

### **1. Relevant Documentation & Diagrams**

*   **Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections high-level-overview --actor frontend-engineer`**: Defines POC goals and validation criteria for testing focus

### **2. Key Design Patterns & Principles**

*   **Test Plan Documentation**: Systematic test plan ensures comprehensive coverage and repeatability

*   **Manual Testing Checklist**: Step-by-step validation of all user flows and acceptance criteria

*   **Bug Tracking**: Document any issues discovered for prioritization and resolution

### **3. Constraints & Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

*   Do not skip edge case testing - validate error handling thoroughly

*   Do not test only on one browser - verify cross-browser compatibility

*   Do not assume mobile works - physically test on actual devices

*   Do not write automated tests yet - manual validation sufficient for POC

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

### **1. Additional Context**

With all features and polish complete, the POC requires systematic validation to ensure it delivers on the core value proposition - helping travelers create personalized trip plans quickly. This ticket covers functional testing, cross-browser compatibility, edge case validation, and user flow verification. Success means confidence that the POC demonstrates product viability and provides a solid foundation for production development decisions.

### **2. Acceptance Criteria**

*   **As a** developer, **I want to** I want to verify all user flows work correctly across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, **so that** we know the POC works for users regardless of browser choice.

*   **As a** developer, **I want to** I want to test edge cases like invalid inputs, API failures, and storage limits, **so that** we identify and document any remaining issues before user testing.

*   **As a** developer, **I want to** I want to verify responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop, **so that** we confirm the experience is acceptable across common devices.

*   **As a** product manager, **I want to** I want to see documented test results and acceptance criteria verification, **so that** I can confidently present the POC to stakeholders and users.

*   **As an** agent working on this task, **I want to** submit a progress log for each Phase completed, **so that** I can keep track of my progress and review it with the team.
