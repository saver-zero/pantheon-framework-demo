# **Ticket T013:** Implement loading states and progress indicators

## Metadata

*   **Ticket ID:** T013
*   **Assigned to:** frontend-engineer

*   **Priority:** P2
*   **Last updated:** 2025-10-14 HH:MM PM PDT
*   **Created by:** tech-lead

*   **Dependencies:** T008 (generation flow provides loading state hooks)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Add loading indicators and progress feedback to improve user experience during itinerary generation. Users should see clear visual feedback that work is happening during the potentially lengthy AI generation process, with appropriate messaging and animations to maintain engagement.

---

## ðŸ“š Architectural Context & References

### **1. Relevant Documentation & Diagrams**

*   **Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections core-principles --actor frontend-engineer`**: Progressive Enhancement principle guides loading state as polish layer

### **2. Key Design Patterns & Principles**

*   **Loading Component**: Reusable loading indicator used across different operations

*   **Conditional Rendering**: Show/hide loading state based on generation flow status

*   **Disabled State Management**: Prevent interaction with form during processing

### **3. Constraints & Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

*   Do not show progress percentages - generation time is unpredictable

*   Do not add complex animations - simple spinner or pulse is sufficient

*   Do not implement cancellation - generation completes or errors

*   Do not show loading state for instant operations like history view

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

### **1. Additional Context**

AI-powered itinerary generation can take several seconds or more, especially when running CLI commands in POC mode. Users need visual confirmation that the system is working and hasn't frozen. Loading states prevent user confusion and abandoned submissions while providing opportunities for helpful messaging about what's happening. This polish work enhances perceived performance and user confidence in the application.

### **2. Acceptance Criteria**

*   **As a** user, **I want to** I want to see a loading indicator immediately after submitting the form, **so that** I know the system is processing my request.

*   **As a** user, **I want to** I want to see helpful messaging during generation, **so that** I understand what's happening and feel engaged.

*   **As a** user, **I want to** I want the form disabled during generation, **so that** I can't accidentally submit duplicate requests.

*   **As a** user, **I want to** I want smooth transitions between loading and result display, **so that** the experience feels polished and professional.

*   **As an** agent working on this task, **I want to** submit a progress log for each Phase completed, **so that** I can keep track of my progress and review it with the team.

## Technical Implementation Plan

**Plan Updated**: 2025-10-18 HH:MM AM PDT

**Created By**: @frontend-engineer

### **Technical Summary**

*   **Relevant Code Analyzed**:

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\App.tsx`: App component already implements loading state management with isLoading useState hook (line 59), state machine transitions in handleGenerate callback, and conditional rendering of loading indicator (lines 146-150). Current implementation shows simple text 'Generating your itinerary...' with proper accessibility attributes.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ItineraryForm.tsx`: ItineraryForm component manages its own loading state for button disable/enable (line 41), button text switching between 'Generate Itinerary' and 'Generating...' (lines 224-225), and coordinates with App-level loading state through the async flow. Existing implementation already prevents duplicate submissions during generation.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ErrorDisplay.tsx`: ErrorDisplay component provides the accessibility and styling patterns to follow for the LoadingIndicator component, including role='alert', aria-live='polite', and inline style approach for MVP pending styling architecture decision.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\App.test.tsx`: App component test suite includes comprehensive loading state tests (lines 300-380) with helper functions for verifying loading state lifecycle, ensuring loading indicator appears and disappears correctly, and coordinating state between form and display components.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ItineraryForm.test.tsx`: Form component test suite includes loading state tests (lines 312-397) verifying button disable during generation, button text changes, and re-enable after completion. These existing tests will validate that form loading state continues working after LoadingIndicator integration.

*   **Proposed Libraries**:

    *   *No new libraries are proposed.*

*   **Key Modules to be Modified/Created**:

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\LoadingIndicator.tsx`: New reusable loading indicator component with spinner animation, messaging support, and accessibility attributes. Will be created following ErrorDisplay component patterns.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\App.tsx`: Update lines 146-150 to replace inline loading text with LoadingIndicator component import and usage, maintaining existing conditional rendering logic based on isLoading state.

    *   `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\LoadingIndicator.test.tsx`: New test file for LoadingIndicator component covering rendering with default message, custom message prop, accessibility attributes, and spinner animation presence.

---

### **High-Level Approach**

The loading states and progress indicators implementation leverages the existing state machine architecture already established in the App and ItineraryForm components. The current codebase already manages loading states through the isLoading boolean in both components, with form button text changes ("Generate Itinerary" to "Generating...") and button disable functionality fully implemented. This ticket focuses on enhancing the visual feedback by adding a polished loading indicator component positioned between the form and itinerary display areas, improving the user experience during AI-powered generation operations that can take several seconds.

The implementation follows the Progressive Enhancement principle from the architecture guide, treating loading states as a polish layer built on top of the already-functioning core generation flow. We will create a reusable LoadingIndicator component with proper accessibility attributes (role="status", aria-live="polite") and smooth CSS-based animations. The App component already conditionally renders loading feedback at line 146-150, showing "Generating your itinerary..." text - we will replace this with the new LoadingIndicator component while maintaining the same conditional rendering logic.

This approach requires minimal changes to existing state management, reuses the established isLoading state from the App component, and maintains the existing error handling and state machine patterns. The implementation will be purely additive, enhancing user experience without modifying core business logic or introducing new state management complexity.

---

### **Implementation Phase**

#### **Primary Objective: Follow the Plan with Strict Fidelity**

The most important directive is to execute this plan exactly as written. Adherence to the prescribed plan and process is more critical than the speed of completion.

Do not skip, combine, or reorder any phase or step. Each one is mandatory and serves a specific purpose in ensuring a high-quality, transparent, and verifiable outcome.
* Sequential Execution: All steps within a phase must be completed before proceeding to the next.

The deliverable is not just the functioning software. It is the  complete, documented, and auditable record of the development process itself, created for human review by following every step with precision.

Always use `pantheon` command directly, never use `python -m pantheon`, it will NOT work.

#### Phase 1: Store current baseline commit info.

Ticket ID: T013

Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections baseline_commit --actor <your_agent_name>` and follow the instruction to set the baseline commit for code review later. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

#### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

Tests will validate that LoadingIndicator integration maintains existing App and Form component behavior without modifying state management logic. Tests must verify that LoadingIndicator appears/disappears based on App-level isLoading state while Form component continues managing its own button disable state independently. All loading state tests should use async waitFor to handle React state updates and avoid race conditions.

**Step 1. Get the testing strategy:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections testing-strategy --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the testing strategy.

**Step 2. (branch). Check testing strategy:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if testing strategy exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Testing strategy exists:** If testing strategy exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Testing strategy does not exist:** If testing strategy does not exist or has empty content, then check for additional documentation. Use `pantheon get team-data --key path.docs --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the documentation directory.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 2. **Understand the Documentation Structure:** Leverage any README or INDEX files and the directory structure to understand the overall documentation structure.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 3. **Read Existing Documentation:** Identify and read documentation related to testing to build context.

 

**Step 3. Review existing test patterns**

Examine current testing patterns and conventions:
 
  - `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\App.test.tsx`: Uses helper functions (createMockService, fillFormWithValidData, waitForErrorMessage, verifyLoadingStateLifecycle) to reduce duplication. Loading state tests verify lifecycle (appears then disappears) using waitFor for async assertions. Mocks service factory with vi.mock('./services') and beforeEach cleanup. Tests loading state coordination between form and display components (lines 356-379).
 
  - `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ItineraryForm.test.tsx`: Wraps components with ItineraryServiceProvider to inject mock service via context. Uses fillFormWithValidData helper for consistent test data. Loading state tests verify button disable (line 336-338), button text change (line 370), and re-enable after completion (line 393-394). Implements slow async mocks using setTimeout in Promises for timing-dependent tests (lines 315-323).
 
  - `C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ErrorDisplay.test.tsx`: Tests component rendering with different prop combinations, accessibility attributes (role='alert', aria-live), conditional rendering of optional elements (retry button), and style attributes for different error types. Uses describe blocks to organize tests by feature area. Simple, focused tests without complex mocking.
 

  *Requirements:*
  - Understanding of Project uses Vitest as test runner with React Testing Library for component testing. Test files follow the pattern ComponentName.test.tsx in the same directory as components. Setup file at src/setupTests.ts configures testing-library matchers. Mock creation uses vi.fn() from Vitest, with beforeEach hooks for clean test isolation.
  - Knowledge of Mock services created with createMockService helper returning IItineraryService with vi.fn() implementations. Async mocks use Promises with setTimeout for timing-dependent tests. React Testing Library screen queries (getByRole, getByText, getByLabelText) for user-centric assertions. waitFor for async state updates with expect assertions inside.

**Step 4. Set up test infrastructure**

Leverage existing components:
 
  - screen queries from @testing-library/react (getByRole, getByText, queryByText) for element assertions
 
  - waitFor utility for async state update verification
 
  - vi.fn() mock functions and vi.mock() module mocking from Vitest
 
  - beforeEach hook pattern for test isolation and mock cleanup
 
  - Helper function pattern (createMockService, fillFormWithValidData) for test data setup
 
  - Mock slow async operations using Promise with setTimeout for timing-dependent behavior tests
 

Create new components as needed:
 
  - Spinner element query helper or test-id attribute on spinner: LoadingIndicator spinner is a div with CSS styling, not a semantic HTML element or text content. React Testing Library prioritizes accessible queries, but spinner animations are visual-only. Adding data-testid='loading-spinner' to spinner div enables testing without compromising accessibility or relying on implementation-specific CSS selectors.
 

  *Requirements:*
  - Test fixtures and mocks are properly configured

 

**Step 5. Write tests for: LoadingIndicator component renders with spinner animation and default message text**

Render LoadingIndicator and verify spinner element exists in DOM, message text displays 'Generating your itinerary...', and component structure is present using screen.getByText and querySelector for spinner element

  *Reference:* ErrorDisplay.test.tsx renders component and verifies message display (lines testing errorMessage prop rendering)

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 6. Write tests for: LoadingIndicator component includes proper accessibility attributes for screen reader announcements**

Render LoadingIndicator and assert role='status' and aria-live='polite' attributes are present on container element using screen.getByRole('status') and toHaveAttribute matcher

  *Reference:* ErrorDisplay.test.tsx verifies role='alert' and aria-live='polite' attributes on error display container

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 7. Write tests for: LoadingIndicator accepts custom message prop to override default text**

Render LoadingIndicator with message='Custom loading text' prop and verify custom message displays instead of default using screen.getByText with custom message

  *Reference:* ErrorDisplay.test.tsx tests errorMessage prop with different values to verify custom message display

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 8. Write tests for: App component displays LoadingIndicator during generation and hides it after completion**

Use existing verifyLoadingStateLifecycle helper pattern from App.test.tsx (lines 51-69) to verify LoadingIndicator appears during async operation and disappears after completion using waitFor and screen.getByText/queryByText

  *Reference:* App.test.tsx lines 301-307 test 'should display loading indicator during generation and remove after completion' using verifyLoadingStateLifecycle helper

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 9. Write tests for: LoadingIndicator positioning between form and content maintains proper visual hierarchy and layout**

Render App with mock service, trigger generation, verify LoadingIndicator appears in DOM between form and error/itinerary display using container.querySelector and DOM traversal to check element order

  *Reference:* App.test.tsx tests verify element presence and positioning through screen queries and role-based lookups

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests written as if working implementation exists
  - Tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures
  - Test validates the specific behavior clearly
  - To not skip tests or mark them for skipping.

 

**Step 10. Verify tests fail**

Run the tests and verify the tests fail as expected.

  *Requirements:*
  - Tests are run
  - Newly written tests fail naturally due to missing implementation, not artificial failures

**Step 11. Draft a commit message**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Define LoadingIndicatorProps interface with message: string and optional className: string
 
  - Export LoadingIndicator as named export consistent with other components
 
  - Default message prop to 'Generating your itinerary...' to match current App component text
 

  *Methodology:* Follow ErrorDisplay component structure from C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\src\components\ErrorDisplay.tsx as the pattern reference, implementing functional component with props interface and proper TypeScript typing

 

**Step 2. Implement accessibility attributes with role='status' and aria-live='polite' for screen reader announcements**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Use role='status' to indicate non-critical status update to assistive technologies
 
  - Use aria-live='polite' to announce loading state changes without interrupting user
 
  - Position message text before spinner for logical screen reader reading order
 

  *Methodology:* Apply WCAG accessibility guidelines matching the pattern used in ErrorDisplay component (lines 70-71) and existing App loading indicator (line 147)

 

**Step 3. Create CSS-based spinner animation using inline styles for MVP consistency with existing component styling approach**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Use border-based circular spinner with partial border for rotation effect
 
  - Implement smooth rotation animation with 1-second duration and linear timing
 
  - Size spinner appropriately (32px-40px diameter) for visibility without overwhelming
 
  - Use neutral color (gray/blue) that works with default browser styling
 
  - Position spinner and text horizontally with flexbox for proper alignment
 

  *Methodology:* Implement simple, performant CSS animation using @keyframes for rotation, following the inline style pattern from ErrorDisplay component to maintain styling consistency until styling architecture decision is made

 

**Step 4. Add optional message customization through message prop to support different loading contexts in future**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Message prop accepts string value for customizable loading text
 
  - Default to 'Generating your itinerary...' matching current App implementation
 
  - Support future use cases like 'Saving to history...' or 'Loading history...' without component changes

#### Phase 4: Integrate LoadingIndicator into App Component

Replace the existing inline loading text in App component with the new LoadingIndicator component while maintaining all existing state management and conditional rendering logic And submit a progress log upon Phase 4 completion.

 

**Step 1. Import LoadingIndicator component into App.tsx**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Import LoadingIndicator from './components/LoadingIndicator'
 
  - Maintain alphabetical ordering of component imports for consistency
 

  *Methodology:* Add named import statement following existing component import pattern (lines 6-8 in App.tsx)

 

**Step 2. Replace inline loading div (lines 146-150) with LoadingIndicator component while preserving conditional rendering logic**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Keep conditional rendering: {isLoading && <LoadingIndicator />}
 
  - Maintain positioning between ItineraryForm and ErrorDisplay components
 
  - Remove inline div with role='status' and replace with LoadingIndicator component
 
  - Use default message prop (no explicit prop needed) to match existing 'Generating your itinerary...' text
 
  - Preserve margin spacing with className or inline style to maintain layout consistency
 

  *Methodology:* Update JSX to use LoadingIndicator component within the same conditional block based on isLoading state, maintaining position between form and content areas

 

**Step 3. Verify that existing App-level isLoading state continues to drive LoadingIndicator visibility without any state management changes**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - No changes to isLoading useState hook or state management logic
 
  - LoadingIndicator appears when isLoading=true (line 87 sets state)
 
  - LoadingIndicator disappears when isLoading=false (line 135 clears state in finally block)
 
  - State machine transitions (idle->loading, loading->success, loading->error) remain unchanged
 

  *Methodology:* Review handleGenerate callback flow to confirm isLoading state transitions (lines 85-136) will automatically show/hide LoadingIndicator without modification

 

**Step 4. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 4 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work.

Add and commit all changes from Phase 4 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 4 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

---

 

#### Phase 5: Verify Form Disabled State Integration

Confirm that existing ItineraryForm component disabled state continues to work correctly in coordination with the new LoadingIndicator, preventing duplicate submissions during generation And submit a progress log upon Phase 5 completion.

 

**Step 1. Review ItineraryForm loading state management to confirm button disable logic coordinates with App-level loading indicator**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Form component maintains its own isLoading state for button control (line 41)
 
  - Button disabled attribute is set correctly during loading (line 224)
 
  - Button text changes from 'Generate Itinerary' to 'Generating...' during loading (line 225)
 
  - Form isLoading state is set in handleSubmit before service call (line 112)
 
  - Form isLoading state is cleared in finally block after completion (line 139)
 

  *Methodology:* Examine ItineraryForm.tsx implementation (lines 111-139) to verify form manages its own isLoading state independently and disables button during async operations

 

**Step 2. Verify that App and Form loading states coordinate through the async flow without tight coupling**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Form sets isLoading=true before calling service.generateItinerary (line 112)
 
  - App sets isLoading=true when handleGenerate callback starts (line 87)
 
  - Both loading states are true during service call, showing both button disable and loading indicator
 
  - Form clears isLoading first when service completes (line 139)
 
  - App clears isLoading after history save completes (line 135)
 
  - No shared loading state or tight coupling between components
 

  *Methodology:* Trace the execution flow from form submission through handleSubmit -> service.generateItinerary -> onGenerate callback to confirm both components manage loading states independently but synchronously

 

**Step 3. Document the dual loading state pattern in component comments for future maintainers**

  *Requirements:*
 
  - Comment in App explaining that App-level loading state drives the visual LoadingIndicator between form and content
 
  - Comment in Form explaining that Form-level loading state manages button disable/enable and text changes
 
  - Note that both states coordinate naturally through the async callback flow without explicit synchronization
 

  *Methodology:* Add inline comments explaining why both App and Form manage separate loading states and how they coordinate through the async flow

 

**Step 4. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 5 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  - Branch 4-3 Step 4. **Return to Step 3:** Re-run integration tests from Step 3 to verify the fix and check for additional failures.

**Step 5. (branch). Check for other tests:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if other test types are available (e.g., end-to-end, acceptance).
  - Branch 5-1 Step 1. **Run the remaining tests:** If other tests exist, then execute the other remaining tests for complete validation.
  - Branch 5-2 Step 1. **No integration tests:** If there are no other tests available, continue to the next step.

**Step 5 (branch). Evaluate remaining test results:** Perform a branch condition check. Determine if all remaining tests passed:
  - Branch 5-1 Step 1. **All remaining tests pass:** If all remaining tests pass, then proceed to the next step.

  - Branch 5-3 Step 1. **Analyze failure:** If any remaining tests fail, then examine the failure output to identify the specific test failure, error message, and stack trace.
  - Branch 5-3 Step 2. **Determine fix type:** Assess whether the failure indicates a code bug requiring implementation changes, or a test requiring updates based on new requirements from this ticket.
  - Branch 5-3 Step 3. **Apply correction:** Make the necessary code or test changes to address the identified issue, following existing code patterns and test conventions.
  - Branch 5-3 Step 4. **Return to Step 5:** Re-run remaining tests from Step 5 to verify the fix and check for additional failures.

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T013

If any updates were made to fix any failing tests during Phase 6, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - If no fixes were made, commit message is not drafted.
  - If fixes were made, commit messge for Phase 6 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log:**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 6 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 6 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

If any updates were made to fix any failing tests during Phase 6, add and commit all changes from Phase 6 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - If no fixes were made in Phase 6, nothing is added or commited as there weren't any changes.
  - If fixes were made in Phase 6, Phase 6 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

#### Phase 7: Documentation Update

Documentation updates focus on adding comprehensive loading states guidance to the User Interface section. The new Loading States Guide will document the LoadingIndicator component API, dual loading state pattern, and accessibility considerations following the structure and style of existing Error Handling Guide. The Form Submission Sequence diagram will be updated to show LoadingIndicator visibility timing and dual state coordination. The master README index will add a new entry linking to the Loading States Guide, maintaining consistency with existing documentation organization.  And submit a progress log upon Phase 7 completion.

**Existing Documentation**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\README.md**: Master documentation index is current and well-organized. User Interface section (lines 32-38) includes Form Validation Guide, Error Handling Guide, Markdown Rendering Guide, Form Submission Sequence diagram, and Error Boundary Lifecycle diagram. No existing loading states documentation.
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\form-submission-sequence.puml**: Sequence diagram shows form submission flow including validation, service call, and result handling. Includes loading state management in the sequence (ItineraryForm sets isLoading=true/false) but does not detail the visual LoadingIndicator component or App-level loading indicator display.
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\error-handling-guide.md**: Comprehensive guide to error handling patterns including ErrorDisplay component documentation. Could serve as pattern reference for loading states documentation structure and style.
 

**Step 1. Get the documentation standards:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections documentation-standards --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the documentation standards.

**Step 2. (branch). Check documentation standards:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if documentation standards exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Documentation standards exists:** If documentation standards exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Documentation standards does not exist:** If documentation standards does not exist or has empty content, continue to the next steps without looking for further documentation standards.

 

**Step 3. Update Documentation**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\form-submission-sequence.puml**: Add LoadingIndicator component to the sequence diagram showing when it appears (after form submission when isLoading=true) and when it disappears (after generation completes when isLoading=false). Illustrate the dual loading state pattern with Form component managing button disable state and App component managing LoadingIndicator visibility.

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\README.md**: Add new entry in User Interface section for Loading States Guide documentation after Markdown Rendering Guide entry (after line 35). Follow existing format: '* **[Loading States Guide](./user-interface/loading-states-guide.md):** Guide to loading indicator implementation, dual loading state pattern, and user feedback during async operations.'

 

**Step 4. Create New Documentation**
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\loading-states-guide.md**: Provide comprehensive guide to loading states implementation including LoadingIndicator component API, dual loading state pattern between App and Form components, accessibility considerations, and usage examples for future enhancements
  > ## Loading States Guide

### LoadingIndicator Component
- Component API (props: message, className)
- Accessibility attributes (role='status', aria-live='polite')
- Spinner animation implementation
- Usage examples with code snippets

### Dual Loading State Pattern
- App-level loading state for visual indicator between form and content
- Form-level loading state for button disable and text changes
- How the two states coordinate through async callback flow
- Why separate states provide better component isolation

### Integration Points
- Where LoadingIndicator appears in App component (between form and content)
- How isLoading state drives visibility
- State machine transitions (idle->loading->success/error)

### Accessibility Considerations
- Screen reader announcements with aria-live='polite'
- Non-intrusive status updates with role='status'
- Visual indicators (spinner) supplementing text messages

### Future Enhancements
- Custom messages for different loading contexts
- Progress percentage indicators (if generation time becomes predictable)
- Cancellation support (if backend supports abort)

 

**Step 5. Update README**
Use `pantheon get team-data --key path.docs --actor <your_agent_name>` and update the README file in the docs directory to add a reference to the new docs created.

**Step 6. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 7 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 7 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.

**Step 7. Submit a progress log:**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 7 is completed, submit a progress log. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections progress_log --actor <your_agent_name>`. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Progress log for Phase 7 is submitted.

**Step 8. Add and commit the changes**

Add and commit all changes from Phase 7 using `git add .` (to ensure no uncommited changes) and `git commit`. Use the commit message drafted.

  *Requirements:*
  - Phase 7 changes are committed using the commit message drafted.

#### Phase 8: Diagram Update

Diagram updates focus on documenting the new LoadingIndicator component in existing architecture and sequence diagrams. The Form Submission Sequence diagram will be enhanced to show LoadingIndicator activation/deactivation timing during the generation flow, illustrating the dual loading state pattern. The Component Overview diagram will add LoadingIndicator as a UI component to maintain complete architectural documentation. No new diagrams are needed since existing diagrams cover the relevant views (sequence and component overview). And submit a progress log upon Phase 8 completion.

**Existing Diagrams:**

 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\form-submission-sequence.puml**: Diagram accurately shows form submission flow with validation, service call via IItineraryService, and result handling. Shows ItineraryForm loading state management (activate/deactivate ItineraryForm for loading state) but does not show LoadingIndicator component or App-level loading indicator display positioned between form and content.
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\system-architecture\component-overview.puml**: High-level component diagram showing frontend components and backend architecture. Does not include LoadingIndicator component since it didn't exist when diagram was created. Diagram is accurate for overall architecture but will benefit from showing LoadingIndicator as a UI component.
 

**Step 1. Get the diagramming standards:** Use `pantheon execute get-architecture-guide --sections diagramming-standards --actor <your_agent_name>` to get the the diagramming standards.

**Step 2. (branch). Check diagramming standards:** Perform a branch condition check. Check if diagramming standards exists with content:
  - Branch 2-1 Step 1. **Diagramming standards exists:** If diagramming standards exists with content, then read the content and continue to the next step.
  - Branch 2-2 Step 1. **Diagramming standards does not exist:** If diagramming standards does not exist or has empty content, continue to the next steps without looking for further diagramming standards.

 

**Step 3. Update Diagrams**
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\user-interface\form-submission-sequence.puml** (sequence): Add LoadingIndicator component as a participant in the sequence. After 'User submits form' step, add activation of LoadingIndicator when App component sets isLoading=true. Show LoadingIndicator displaying with message 'Generating your itinerary...'. After 'Service returns markdown' step, add deactivation of LoadingIndicator when App component sets isLoading=false in finally block. Illustrate timing relationship between Form button disable state and LoadingIndicator visibility.
 
- **C:\git\pantheon-demo-projects\pantheon-check-everything\pantheon-artifacts\docs\system-architecture\component-overview.puml** (component): Add LoadingIndicator as a UI component under the Frontend section alongside ItineraryForm, ErrorDisplay, and ItineraryDisplay components. Show LoadingIndicator connected to App component with note indicating conditional rendering based on isLoading state. Maintain existing component relationships and architecture without modifications.
 

**Step 4. Draft a commit message**

Ticket ID: T013

After Phase 8 is completed, draft a commit message, without commiting or staging any files. Use `pantheon get process update-ticket --sections commit_message --actor <your_agent_name>`. This ensures the commit message will be drafted without files being committed or staged. <your_agent_name> is your authentic identity executing this work. Do not simply use the ticket's "Assigned to" field unless you ARE that agent. Examples: claude-code, codex, gemini, or <agent-role-name> (i.e backend-engineer, only if explicitly instantiated as that agent).

  *Requirements:*
  - Commit messge for Phase 8 is drafted using the Pantheon tool, without commiting or staging any files.
