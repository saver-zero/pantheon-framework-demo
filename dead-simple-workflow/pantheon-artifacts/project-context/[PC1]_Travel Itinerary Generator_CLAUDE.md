# Project Overview

## Product: Travel Itinerary Generator

### Vision

Planning multi-day trips currently requires hours of research across multiple websites, guidebooks, and forums, leading to decision fatigue and suboptimal itineraries. This product generates personalized day-by-day travel schedules in seconds by understanding destination, party composition, trip duration, and seasonal timing, delivering structured plans that first-time visitors can immediately use without extensive planning overhead.

### Target Users

Primary users are first-time visitors to destinations who want structured itineraries without investing significant planning time. Secondary users are travelers seeking inspiration and starting points for trip planning. Demographics span all age groups with various party compositions including solo travelers, couples, families with children, and groups. Users value convenience, personalization based on their specific group dynamics, and seasonal appropriateness over exhaustive customization options.

### Core MVP Features

- Four-input generation form (destination, party info, month of travel, trip duration)

- AI-powered personalized itinerary generation using Claude CLI

- Day-by-day breakdown with flexible time periods (morning/afternoon/evening/night/late night)

- Activity cards showing attraction name, description, what to do, and dining recommendations

- Local storage history displaying last 10 generated itineraries

- Seasonal and demographic-aware activity filtering

- Loading states and error handling for generation process

- Responsive single-page interface requiring no authentication

### Success Criteria

MVP is complete when: (1) Users can input destination, party info, month, and days, then receive a structured itinerary within 30 seconds. (2) Generated itineraries display day-by-day with time periods, showing attraction names, descriptions, activities, and dining recommendations. (3) History view shows last 10 generated itineraries stored in localStorage. (4) Error states display when CLI generation fails or times out. (5) UI is responsive and usable on desktop browsers. (6) At least 3 test itineraries for different party types and destinations validate appropriate personalization. No polish, no optimization, no additional features - focus is proving the core generation quality justifies further investment.

## Project Context

This project creates an MVP travel itinerary generator that produces personalized day-by-day trip schedules. The product targets first-time visitors to destinations who want structured plans without extensive research. The MVP is scoped as a frontend-only proof of concept that uses Claude CLI directly for itinerary generation, with an abstraction layer enabling future migration to a production backend. This approach validates the core concept while maintaining a clear path to scalable deployment.

### Key Concepts

**API Abstraction Layer**: Frontend interface that enables switching between CLI-based POC implementation (calls 'claude -p' directly) and future HTTP-based production backend without frontend code changes. Decouples UI from backend implementation details.

**Time Period**: Flexible time-of-day segments (morning, afternoon, evening, night, late night) that structure itinerary activities. Not all periods are required - they're included only when appropriate for the party type and demographics.

**Party Information**: Natural language description of travelers (e.g., 'family of four with 12-year-old boy', 'late 20s Gen Z couple') that guides activity personalization and appropriateness filtering.

**Seasonal Recommendations**: Month-aware activity suggestions that account for weather conditions, seasonal events, and attraction availability specific to the travel timeframe.

**Local History**: Browser localStorage-based persistence of the last 10 generated itineraries, enabling quick reference and repeat access without server-side storage or user accounts.

### Core Capabilities

- Generate personalized multi-day itineraries from minimal user inputs

- Provide day-by-day structured schedules with time-period activities

- Recommend attractions with descriptions and specific activities

- Suggest dining options appropriate to each time period

- Maintain history of generated itineraries for quick reference

- Adapt recommendations based on party composition and demographics

- Account for seasonal timing and weather-appropriate activities

### Key Principles

- Simplicity over features - maximum 3 clicks to generate an itinerary, no registration required

- Frontend-first architecture with backend abstraction for smooth POC-to-production migration

- Ruthless scope constraint to validate core concept within 3-4 week timeline

- Natural language inputs over rigid form fields for better user experience

- Local-first data persistence using browser storage to eliminate backend complexity in MVP

- Structured output format that prioritizes scannability and clarity over detail density

# Technology Stack

## Framework

**React with Vite**

React provides component-based architecture ideal for the itinerary display structure with repeated day/time-period patterns. Vite enables fast local development with instant HMR for rapid iteration during POC phase. This combination supports the frontend-only architecture while maintaining clear component boundaries for future backend integration. No server-side rendering needed for MVP given the local-first approach.

## Database

**Browser localStorage**

localStorage eliminates backend persistence complexity for the POC phase while providing sufficient capacity for 10 itinerary history limit. This enables immediate user value (history feature) without authentication, server infrastructure, or data migration concerns. The abstraction layer design ensures straightforward migration to proper database storage when backend is added in future phases.

## Authentication

**None (MVP)**

Authentication is explicitly out of scope for MVP to minimize implementation complexity and eliminate registration friction. Users can generate and view itineraries immediately. Local storage provides sufficient persistence for the 10-itinerary history requirement without user accounts. Authentication becomes relevant only when cloud-saved itineraries and sharing features are added in Phase 3.

## Hosting

**Local development (POC phase)**

MVP stays local-only to validate core concept without deployment infrastructure overhead. The CLI-based backend implementation requires local Claude access anyway. Future production deployment will use Vercel or Netlify when HTTP backend is implemented, but deployment is deferred until product-market fit is validated through local testing.

## Key Libraries

- **TypeScript**: Type safety for itinerary data model and API contracts. Ensures JSON parsing from CLI output matches expected structure and catches integration issues early.

- **React**: Component framework for UI rendering and state management. Handles day-by-day and time-period component patterns efficiently.

- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server with fast HMR for rapid iteration during POC development.

- **child_process (Node.js)**: Executes 'claude -p' CLI commands from frontend code in POC implementation. Used by CLIApiClient to generate itineraries.

<!-- SECTION:START:ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS -->

# Architectural Patterns

## Code Organization

Frontend follows standard React structure with /src containing /components (itinerary display, form, history), /services (API abstraction layer with CLIApiClient and future HTTPApiClient implementations), /types (TypeScript interfaces for itinerary data model), and /utils (localStorage helpers, prompt template). API abstraction lives in /services/api with interface definition and multiple implementations, enabling clean separation between UI components and backend integration logic.

## State Management

React useState and useEffect hooks for component-level state management. No global state library needed given simple data flow: form inputs are local state, generated itinerary flows one-way from API to display component, history is fetched synchronously from localStorage when history view is opened. The API abstraction layer returns Promises to support future async HTTP calls without changing component code.

## Data Flow

User submits form inputs -> Form component calls API service interface -> CLIApiClient executes 'claude -p' command with hardcoded prompt template -> CLI returns JSON response -> API client parses and validates JSON -> Itinerary data flows to display component for rendering -> Completed itinerary is saved to localStorage history. On history view, localStorage is queried directly and previous itineraries are rendered using same display component. No server roundtrips, no async data fetching beyond the CLI call.

## Key Patterns

### API Abstraction Interface

Define IItineraryService interface with generateItinerary(), getHistory(), and saveToHistory() methods. Implement with CLIApiClient for POC and HTTPApiClient for future production. Components depend only on the interface, enabling backend swapping via configuration flag without UI code changes.

### Component Composition for Time Periods

DayCard component maps over time periods array, rendering TimePeriodCard for each non-null period. This handles flexible time period structure (not all periods required) and maintains consistent styling across morning/afternoon/evening/night/late_night variants.

### Hardcoded Prompt Template

Store complete Claude prompt with JSON schema as string template in API service. Enables rapid prompt iteration without external file management. Future versions can move to prompt optimization but hardcoding minimizes moving parts during POC validation.

### Local Storage as Single Source of Truth for History

History operations read/write directly to localStorage without caching in React state. Simplifies implementation and prevents sync issues. Storage limit of 10 itineraries prevents localStorage overflow while providing sufficient history value.

# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-17 - Pitfall Avoided
ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT race condition occurs when multiple event handlers (exit, error, timeout) on child_process attempt to send HTTP responses concurrently. Solution: Implement a responseSent boolean flag checked at the start of each handler. Set flag to true immediately before calling res.json() or res.status().json() in any handler. This prevents duplicate response attempts and eliminates the race condition.

**Context**: Express backend /api/generate endpoint with child_process spawn




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Simplified data model from complex nested interfaces (Activity[], TimePeriod, Day[]) to simple { markdown: string } dramatically reduced TypeScript complexity while maintaining type safety at API boundaries. This markdown-first approach eliminated 4 interface types and simplified component hierarchy from 4 levels to 1.

**Context**: Data model migration from structured to markdown

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Detailed markdown formatting instructions in prompt template ensure consistent output structure from Claude CLI. Removing JSON schema and replacing with explicit markdown format guidelines (day headings, time periods, activity details) produces more reliable structured output.

**Context**: Prompt engineering for markdown output

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Storing input parameters (destination, party, dates) alongside markdown output in ItineraryMetadata enables rich history display without parsing markdown. This metadata header pattern provides context at a glance while keeping markdown as single source of truth.

**Context**: History storage design

## 2025-10-16 - Pitfall Avoided
Moving old components to archived/ directory instead of deletion provides rollback safety during major refactoring. Archived DayCard, TimePeriodCard, ActivityCard, and ItineraryDisplay components can be restored if markdown approach proves problematic.

**Context**: Component deletion vs archival

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Replaced 4-level component hierarchy (ItineraryDisplay > DayCard > TimePeriodCard > ActivityCard) with single MarkdownItineraryDisplay component. Markdown-based rendering eliminates need for structured data traversal and reduces component coupling.

**Context**: Component hierarchy simplification

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Completely rewrote localStorage functions to handle markdown data instead of structured objects. saveToHistory now creates ItineraryMetadata entries with generatedAt timestamp, while history entries include all input parameters plus markdown for complete context preservation.

**Context**: localStorage function rewrite

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Updated App.tsx to use markdown state (string) instead of structured ItineraryResponse objects. This shift from complex object state to simple string state simplified state management and eliminated unnecessary type conversions.

**Context**: State management simplification

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Enhanced HistoryView with metadata header showing destination, party, and dates above markdown content. This two-tier display (metadata + markdown) provides quick context scanning without requiring users to read full itinerary content.

**Context**: HistoryView enhancement




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Switched from exec to spawn for running Claude CLI on Windows. Spawn requires shell: true and windowsHide: true flags. The stdin.close() call prevents process hanging. This pattern is Windows-specific and critical for reliable subprocess execution.

**Context**: Backend API implementation (server.js)

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Stream handlers must follow this pattern: accumulate data in variables during 'data' events, process accumulated results only on 'exit' event. Do not attempt to process data incrementally - wait for complete output.

**Context**: Backend subprocess handling (server.js)

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Changed response format from structured JSON to plain markdown text. Backend now returns { markdown: stdout.trim() } instead of parsing JSON structure. This simplifies backend logic and shifts rendering responsibility to frontend.

**Context**: Backend API response format (server.js)

## 2025-10-16 - Dependency Issue
react-markdown provides built-in HTML sanitization through remark-rehype. No additional security library (like DOMPurify) is needed for safe markdown rendering. This reduces dependency complexity.

**Context**: Frontend markdown rendering (MarkdownItineraryDisplay)

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Component design follows single responsibility pattern: accepts single markdown string prop, renders with react-markdown, applies comprehensive CSS styling for markdown elements (h1-h6, ul, ol, p, code, blockquote). CSS is colocated in separate file for maintainability.

**Context**: Frontend markdown display component (MarkdownItineraryDisplay)

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Established CSS pattern for markdown content: typography hierarchy with distinct heading sizes, list indentation with markers, code block styling with background and border-radius, blockquote with left border accent. This pattern can be reused for any markdown content display.

**Context**: Frontend CSS styling (MarkdownItineraryDisplay.css)




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Pitfall Avoided
Node.js exec() hangs on Windows when calling 'claude -p' commands. The process never exits even after Claude completes its response, causing timeout failures. Must use spawn() instead with specific configuration: shell: true, windowsHide: true, and critically, stdin.close() immediately after spawning. Without closing stdin, the Claude CLI waits indefinitely for input.

**Context**: Backend server.js process management - Phase 1 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Claude CLI output format changed from JSON to plain markdown text. The initial implementation expected structured JSON matching the schema from requirements, but actual Claude responses are markdown formatted. This requires removing JSON parsing logic from backend and implementing markdown rendering in frontend instead of component hierarchy for structured data.

**Context**: Backend output processing and frontend display - Phases 2-3 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Complete data model pivot from structured JSON (Day, TimePeriod, Activity interfaces) to markdown string storage. This simplifies the architecture significantly but requires refactoring: TypeScript interfaces, localStorage utilities, display components, and the entire component hierarchy (DayCard, TimePeriodCard, ActivityCard) gets replaced with single markdown rendering component.

**Context**: Data model and component architecture - Phases 4-6 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Windows process management for spawn requires specific configuration: spawn('claude', ['-p', prompt], { shell: true, windowsHide: true }). The shell: true is required for Windows command execution, windowsHide: true prevents console window flash. Stream handlers must collect stdout/stderr chunks and process on exit event, not during stream emission.

**Context**: Backend spawn implementation - Phase 1 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
For markdown rendering in React, use react-markdown library with HTML sanitization to prevent XSS. Structure: MarkdownItineraryDisplay component accepts markdown string prop, renders with proper CSS for headings, lists, and paragraphs. This replaces the entire four-level component composition (ItineraryDisplay -> DayCard -> TimePeriodCard -> ActivityCard) with single component.

**Context**: Frontend markdown rendering - Phase 3 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
History storage structure changed from structured ItineraryResponse objects to simple metadata + markdown string. New schema: { destination, partyInfo, month, days, generatedAt, markdown }. This maintains history functionality while adapting to markdown output format. The 10-itinerary limit logic remains unchanged.

**Context**: localStorage utilities - Phase 5 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Prompt template must explicitly request markdown output format instead of JSON schema. Remove JSON schema from template and add markdown structure instructions: specify day headings, time period sections, activity details format. The prompt should guide Claude to produce well-structured markdown that renders properly without requiring post-processing.

**Context**: CLIApiClient prompt template - Phase 7 of IP2

## 2025-10-16 - Lesson Learned
Phases 1-7 of IP1 were completed successfully building the structured JSON approach, but architectural assumptions about Claude CLI output format were wrong. Always validate external API/CLI output format early before building dependent components. Testing actual Claude CLI responses in Phase 2 would have caught this issue before implementing all display components.

**Context**: Development process - IP1 completion before IP2 creation

## 2025-10-16 - Dependency Issue
The backend abstraction architecture (IItineraryService interface) proved valuable during this pivot. Changing from JSON to markdown only required updating CLIApiClient implementation and related types, not the entire application. The frontend components were already isolated from backend implementation details through the service interface.

**Context**: API abstraction layer value - architecture validation

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
When pivoting data models mid-implementation, archive old components instead of deleting them immediately. Keep DayCard, TimePeriodCard, ActivityCard in /src/components/archived/ during transition in case rollback is needed. Remove only after markdown approach is validated through testing.

**Context**: Component refactoring - Phase 6 of IP2




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Use Promise.race() for fetch timeout implementation. Race the fetch against a timeout promise that rejects after 30 seconds. This provides clean timeout error messaging without aborting the underlying request.

**Context**: CLIApiClient.ts:93-110 - API timeout handling

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Centralize loading and error state management in parent App component rather than distributing across child components. This keeps form component simple and maintains single source of truth for UI states. LoadingSpinner and ErrorMessage are separate reusable components.

**Context**: App.tsx:59-72 - State management pattern

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Propagate isLoading prop from App down to ItineraryForm to disable all inputs during generation. This prevents users from modifying form data while request is in flight. Change button text to 'Generating...' for clear feedback.

**Context**: ItineraryForm.tsx - Form state during async operations

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Establish design system using CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and border radius. Follow naming convention --category-modifier (e.g., --spacing-lg, --primary-color). This ensures visual consistency and makes global design changes trivial.

**Context**: styles/global.css - Design system variables

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Implement mobile-first responsive design with two primary breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 480px (mobile). Pattern: start with desktop styles, then use @media (max-width: 768px) and @media (max-width: 480px) to adjust for smaller screens. Works well for POC phase.

**Context**: All component CSS files - Responsive design approach

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Use component-scoped CSS pattern where each component imports its own CSS file. Keep styling close to components while avoiding naming conflicts through component-specific class names (e.g., .itinerary-form, .day-card, .activity-card). Simpler approach appropriate for MVP scope than CSS modules or styled-components.

**Context**: Component CSS architecture

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Create visual hierarchy using box-shadow variables (--shadow-sm, --shadow-md, --shadow-lg, --shadow-xl) consistently across components. Cards use shadows to lift off the page, with hover effects increasing shadow size for interactivity feedback. Border colors maintain subtle separation.

**Context**: Component styling - Visual hierarchy

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Implement accessible focus states for all form inputs with border color change and subtle box shadow. This provides clear visual feedback for keyboard navigation users while maintaining clean aesthetic.

**Context**: ItineraryForm.css:33-37 - Accessibility pattern

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Note
LoadingSpinner and ErrorMessage components are generic and reusable, not tied to itinerary generation specifically. Consider moving to shared /components/common directory in future refactoring for better code organization.

**Context**: Component organization - Future refactoring consideration

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Note
Timeout implementation in CLIApiClient is at the API client level. Any future API methods will need their own timeout handling. Consider extracting this into a wrapper function if more API methods are added to avoid duplication.

**Context**: CLIApiClient.ts - Timeout pattern reusability

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Import global CSS in main.tsx to ensure design system is available before any component renders. This prevents flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and guarantees CSS variables are defined for all components.

**Context**: main.tsx - CSS loading order




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Initial CLIApiClient implementation attempted to use Node.js child_process directly in browser code, which failed Vite build with 'Module externalized for browser compatibility' errors. The architecture already had a backend server (server.js) running on port 3001 with a /api/generate endpoint that handles Claude CLI execution. Updated CLIApiClient to use browser fetch API to call this backend endpoint instead. This aligns with the API Abstraction Layer principle - the frontend doesn't care how the backend executes, just that it gets JSON responses.

**Context**: Phase 4 & 5 Implementation - CLIApiClient

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
All TypeScript type imports must use 'import type' syntax when verbatimModuleSyntax is enabled in tsconfig. Regular imports like 'import { ItineraryResponse }' cause TS1484 errors. Changed all type imports to 'import type { ItineraryResponse }' throughout components, services, and utils.

**Context**: TypeScript compilation with verbatimModuleSyntax

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Time periods 'night' and 'late_night' are optional in the Day interface (marked with ?). When passing to TimePeriodCard which expects Activity[] | null, TypeScript complained that undefined is not assignable. Used nullish coalescing operator (??) to convert undefined to null: `activities={day.night ?? null}`. This maintains type safety while handling optional fields cleanly.

**Context**: DayCard component handling optional time periods

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Implemented four-level component composition: ItineraryDisplay -> DayCard -> TimePeriodCard -> ActivityCard. Each level handles its own data structure and passes appropriate props down. TimePeriodCard includes conditional rendering (returns null if no activities), which keeps parent components simple and moves rendering logic to the appropriate level.

**Context**: Display component hierarchy

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Implemented history management with unshift (add to front) and slice(0, 10) pattern to maintain most recent 10 itineraries. The saveToHistory function is called automatically by CLIApiClient after successful generation, ensuring history stays synchronized without requiring components to know about storage logic.

**Context**: localStorage utility implementation




# Implementation Insights

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Form state management pattern: Used individual useState hooks for each form field (destination, partyInfo, month, days) rather than a single form state object. This pattern works well for simple forms with independent validation requirements and provides clearer data flow when passing values to parent via onSubmit callback.

**Context**: ItineraryForm component implementation

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
HTML5 validation approach: Implemented form validation using native HTML attributes (required, min=1, max=30) instead of custom validation logic. This provides immediate user feedback without additional state management or validation libraries, sufficient for MVP scope.

**Context**: ItineraryForm validation implementation

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Month dropdown uses full text month names ('January', 'February', etc.) as both display labels and values. This approach simplifies the prompt template integration since the month value can be passed directly to Claude CLI without mapping numeric values to names.

**Context**: Month dropdown implementation

## 2025-10-16 - Architecture Change
Form submission pattern: Created explicit onSubmit handler that prevents default form behavior and passes all field values as individual parameters to parent callback. This approach gives parent components full control over submission logic and separates presentation (form component) from business logic (itinerary generation).

**Context**: Form submission handling

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Component interface design: Defined explicit TypeScript interface for ItineraryForm props containing onSubmit callback with typed parameters (destination: string, partyInfo: string, month: string, days: number). This contract ensures type safety at component boundaries and documents expected data flow.

**Context**: TypeScript interface for component props

## 2025-10-16 - Pattern Discovered
Trip duration constraints: Min=1, max=30 days enforced at input level. This range prevents unrealistic itinerary generation requests while covering typical vacation lengths from weekend trips to extended stays. Frontend validation prevents invalid CLI calls.

**Context**: Trip duration input constraints
