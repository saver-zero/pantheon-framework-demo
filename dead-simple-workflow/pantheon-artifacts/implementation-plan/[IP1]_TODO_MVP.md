7.4. [completed] Implement mobile-friendly layout with CSS media queries for screens below 768px width
7.5. [completed] Add final UI polish: consistent button styles, input field styling, card shadows, and visual hierarchy for scannability

## Phase 8: Testing & Validation

8.1. [pending] Test itinerary generation for 'late 20s Gen Z couple' visiting 'Tokyo' in 'March' for '5 days' and verify appropriate personalization
8.2. [pending] Test itinerary generation for 'family of four with 12-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl' visiting 'Disney World' in 'July' for '3 days' and verify family-appropriate activities
8.3. [pending] Test itinerary generation for 'single millennial female' visiting 'Paris, France' in 'December' for '4 days' and verify seasonal appropriateness
8.4. [pending] Verify error handling by testing with invalid inputs and confirming error messages display correctly

## MVP Completion

### Functional Requirements

The MVP is complete when all of these functional requirements are met:

- Users can input destination, party info, month, and trip duration, then generate a structured itinerary within 30 seconds

- Generated itineraries display day-by-day breakdown with time periods (morning/afternoon/evening/night/late night)

- Each time period shows attraction name, description, what to do activities, and dining recommendations

- History view displays last 10 generated itineraries stored in localStorage

- Error states display when CLI generation fails or times out

- UI is responsive and usable on desktop browsers (minimum 1024px width)

- At least 3 test itineraries for different party types and destinations validate appropriate personalization

### Validation Readiness

MVP is ready for user validation when a first-time user can visit the application, fill in the four-input form with their trip details, receive a personalized day-by-day itinerary within 30 seconds showing attractions and dining recommendations appropriate to their party composition and travel month, access their generation history showing up to 10 previous itineraries, and experience proper error handling if generation fails. The application must demonstrate that AI-generated itinerary quality justifies further product investment through observable personalization in the test cases.
