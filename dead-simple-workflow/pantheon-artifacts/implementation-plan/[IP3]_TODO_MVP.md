# Development Phases

## Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Design
Analyze the race condition causing HTTP headers error and design the solution approach using a response-sent flag pattern

## Phase 2: Implementation
Implement the response-sent flag to prevent multiple response sends and ensure proper cleanup

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation
Test the fix under timeout and normal completion scenarios to verify the race condition is resolved

# Implementation Steps

## Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Design

1.1. [completed] Review server.js /api/generate endpoint to identify all response send locations: exit handler (line 54), error handler (line 59), and timeout handler (line 68)
1.2. [completed] Document the race condition: timeout fires at 30s sending response, then exit handler fires when process completes, attempting second response send
1.3. [completed] Design solution using responseSent flag to track if response has been sent and guard all response.json() calls

## Phase 2: Implementation

2.1. [completed] Add responseSent flag initialized to false at the start of the /api/generate request handler
2.2. [completed] Wrap all res.json() and res.status().json() calls with responseSent flag check, setting flag to true after sending
2.3. [completed] Update exit event handler to check responseSent before sending response, ensuring cleanup even if response already sent
2.4. [completed] Update error event handler to check responseSent before sending response
2.5. [completed] Update timeout handler to check responseSent before sending response and set flag after kill

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

3.1. [pending] Test normal completion scenario: send request that completes under 30 seconds, verify single successful response
3.2. [pending] Test timeout scenario: send request that exceeds 30 seconds, verify single timeout response with no headers error
3.3. [pending] Test error scenario: trigger spawn error, verify single error response
3.4. [pending] Review server logs to confirm no ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT errors appear under any scenario

# Completion Criteria

## Phase Completion Gates

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Design
This phase is complete when:

- All three response send locations identified and documented

- Race condition scenario clearly documented with timeline

- Solution design documented with responseSent flag pattern

- Design reviewed and confirmed to handle all edge cases

### Phase 2: Implementation
This phase is complete when:

- responseSent flag added to request handler scope

- All response send operations guarded by responseSent check

- Flag set to true after each response send

- Process cleanup occurs regardless of response state

- Code compiles without syntax errors

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
This phase is complete when:

- Normal completion path tested and working

- Timeout path tested without headers error

- Error path tested without headers error

- No ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT errors in server logs

- Server handles concurrent requests without issues

## MVP Completion

### Functional Requirements

The MVP is complete when all of these functional requirements are met:

- Server /api/generate endpoint handles requests without ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT errors

- Timeout scenario (30+ seconds) returns single timeout response

- Normal completion scenario returns single success response

- Error scenario returns single error response

- Process cleanup occurs in all scenarios

- Server remains stable under concurrent requests

### Validation Readiness

The fix is ready for validation when the server can handle multiple concurrent requests with varying completion times (under timeout, at timeout, over timeout) without producing any ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT errors in the logs, and all requests receive exactly one response.
